To the first Interrogatorie hee saith and deposeth that the
shipp the Saint Jacob interrogated laden with tobacco, sugar,
sumack, and elephants teeth and other goods arived
about fifteene monethes since neere Arundell in Sussex where
her master and company were forced to run her (having sprung
a leake) ashore, which hee knoweth seeing her before and after
such her comming ashore, and saith her master was commonly
called Arent Marinis.

To the second and third hee saith that upon the said running of the said
shipp a ground neere the place a foresaid the said master and
most of his company came ashore and used every meanes and
diligence for preservation of her and her lading, and the next morning began
to take goods out of her, and provided boates and carts to carry
away the said shipps lading to preserve and lay it up
for the owners use, which hee knoweth being one of those that were
imployed therein by the said master, and helping to take out some
of the said goods. And saith that while the said master and company
with the help they had got were the said next morning actually
taking out of goods from the said shipp for their preservation, and
had carts and boates by the said shipps side readie to carry them away,
one called mr howe (said to be steward to the earle of Arundell)
came downe to the said place to the shipps side, and this deponent
speaking to him and saying, hee thought the best anchor and
cable were due to my lord of Arundell for groundage, to which the
said mr howe answered and said, if the best anchor and cable are
due to my lord, the whole shipp and lading are due to him, and
therefore I seize upon all, or words to the same effect, And
otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the fourth hee saith that upon the said howes first comming
the said master being aboard, went by this deponents advise
ashore to speake to him to be a meanes to protest the shipp and lading,
but what hee said unto him, this examinate knoweth not, for hee
staid aboard and went not ashore with the master, but before
the said masters going ashore hee called out of the said shipp to the
said mr howe and told him hee should have the best anchor and cables
howbeit

out in a tumultous manner and said, if they were due to my lord of
Arundell they were due to them (or to the same effect) and therewithall
they fell in a tumultous furious manner aboard, and fell to pulling
cutting and hacking and wholly plundered tooke and carried away
away all the said shipps lading and goods, saving three or foure boates
lading oof the goods and sailes. And that the said people dispossessed
the said master and company of the said goods (saving what was in the
boates as aforesaid) and cut downe all the masts and rigging and
carried the same away alsoe, all which hee knoweth being present and
seeing the same, and seeing the master and company doe their best to
prevent the said spoile, and violence.

To the sixth hee saith hee beleeveth the such comming and speeches
of the said mr how, were and gave the occasion for the said people
soe to fall on and commit the said spoile and outrage, and that if
hee the said how had donne his endeavour and countenanced the master
and company, and opposed the said violence, hee beleeveth the same had not
bin committed, but the said shipp and goo goods or greater part thereof had bin preserved.

To the seaventh hee saith that hee dwelling a good distance from that place
and being but a stranger there, doth not knowe the names of any of the
persons that tooke away any of the goods, tackle, apparell, furniture

safe and free from hurt, which hee knoweth having frequented the said River
as a Mariner.

To the third árticle hee saith that when there are very many shipps
at once in the River of Thames, they are necessitated to ride and lie neere
each other, whereby they are alsoe necessitated to lie with their cables frequently
athwart or crosse each others cables, any by that meanes upon turning of
the tide they are apt to come aboard each other, in which cases the companies
ought to be watchfull and diligent to cleare their shipps, and prevent such
dammage as might befall their shipps by such comming aboard each other.

To the fourth hee saith that in all the time that the said shipps the
Prinse and the White lilly lay together, they never came fowle of or
touched each other but once, (and that was about tenn or twelve dayes
after the Prinses first comming there to an anchor, and that when they
soe touched each other, it was only that the bolt spritt of the white
lilly came against the steme of the Prinse, wherein hee saith the white
lilly received noe hurt, save only the breaking of her Jack staffe, which
in his estimation was not worth above six pence, and saith that when the
bolt spritt of the white lilly came against the Prinses sterne, the Prinses
company hasted to her sterne, and with their hands, put off the said bolt spritt
without hurting the same, which hee knoweth being all the while aboard the
Prinse, and seeing the premisses, and helping soe to cleare the said bolt spritt.

To the fifth hee saith that it was upon the turning of the tide when the
White lillies bolt spritt came against the sterne of the Prinse, and was alsoe
upon the turning of the shipps, at which times shipps companies ought to
be carefull and diligent in veering their cables to shift their shipps shipps
and prevent comming fowle of each other; And saith that when the bolt spritt
of the Lilly came against the sterne of the Prinse, the white
Lillies companie might easily in his iudgement have prevented the
same, with beering two or three fathom of their cable, which they might
and ought to have donne, and further that it was not the fault of the
shipp Prinse or company that the lillies bolt spritt came against her sterne, And
otherwise hee deposeth not.

To the 6th hee saith it is usuall for shipps riding at anchor in the river on
weeke dayes to take downe their Jack staves, because the same are apt to
hang
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.51v Annotate
hang or hitch in the tackling of other shipps, and saith that in case the
White lillies company had taken in her [?iarb] staff (as was donne to most other
shipps, and is usually on the weeke dayes or working dayes) there would noe hurt
or dammage at all have happened to the White lilly, whose bolt spritt came
against the Princes sterne on a working or worke day, all which hee knoweth
having used the sea about 25 yeeres, and being present aboard the Prinse as
aforesaid.

To the seavanth article hee saith and deposeth that during all such time
as the said shipps the White lillie and the Prinse soe lay together, the Prinse
did not soe much as breake one cord or rope yarne of the White lilly
nor drive her from her moorings, and during the said time, the White
Lilly was very carelessly, slightly and loosely moored, in such manner as was
not fitting for her to lie; which the Prinses company seeing, they moored her
both ahead and asterne to prevvant such dammage ás might happen
by reason of such loose and slight mooring of the White lilly, which by
her soe lying, tooke up more roome in the river than three or foure
shipps that were well moored would have donne. And that the lilly by soe
lying was very apt in her turning and swingeing to and againe by the turne
of the tide by reason of her loose mooring, to come fowle of other
vessells that lay well moored. yeelding a reason of his knowledge as
above.

To the eighth hee saith that the White lillies company drew her
or haled the White lilly of up to the chaine alate, and that
shee was not by the Prinse forced a thwart or fowle of the chaine.

To the nineth hee saith that the White lillie had discharged and
delivered out her lading before shee cutt her cable, and when
shee cutt shee was removing from her moorings to moore neerer the shore
and they might (if they had bin pleased) have avoided such cutting
their cable, for the Princes company manned out their boate when
the lillies company were weighing their anchor, and assisted the
White lillies company in such weighing, and clearing the same
from the Prinses cable, and while the companies of both shipps
were soe clearing the White lillies anchor, the white lillies
boatswaine called out to the Prinses company and bade them cut the
White lillies cable, which they (seeing noe neede for soe
doeing) refused, and answered that if hee or his fellowes had any
minde to have it cut, they might doe it them selves, or to the same effect
whereupon the said boatswaine presently cut the same asunder himselfe
which this deponent saith needed not have bin done, for that the
anchor and might and would suddenly have bin cleared without doe such
cutting, but the white lillies company were carelesse and negligent. All
which hee knoweth being present and seeing the same.

To the eleaventh hee saith the lillies companie soe cut their cable
neere or close to the ring thereof, and where the same was very much
worne, as cables in that place use to be, soe that the said
cable was by the said cutting little or nothing damnified, it being
as hee saith usuall for shipps upon each voyage to cutt
off their cable at the rings, to make new fasts. And saith the said
company of the lillie soe cutting close by the ring, did not loose above
a foote of it; and that the Prinses company in their instance held one end
of
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.52r Annotate
of the cable soe cutt in the Prinses boate, untill the lillies companie
had fastened a Manne up their shipp as they desired, and then they called
out to the Prinses company to let goe their cable for (as they said) they
were fast.

To the twelveth hee saith that after the said shipp the White lillie had
removed, and was moored in another place, shee was in the said other
place soe loosely and carelessly moored, that shee drove to and aground in
the River of Thames, and came fowle of other shipps, and ran aground
insoemuch that this deponent heard strangers that went by, say, looke
howe carelessly that shipp is moored, noe body lookes after her. And saith
that in case the false keele or any of the tackle or furniture of the
lillie received any dammage, it was by occasion of such her loose and
undue mooring, and not by any fault of the Prinse or any of her
company.

To the first hee saith hee continued aboard the Prinse for
fifteene dayes together or thereabouts next after her comming to an

without stirring from her, and otherwise referreth himselfe to his foregoeing

To the second hee referreth himselfe to his foregoeing deposition and cannot

and shee being before her comming out of harbour in the Barbadoes
leakie as this deponent well observed) was by the violence of the sayd

with the helpe allsoe of this deponent and other the passengers on

continually pumped with two pumpes soe that the Company of the sayd

was the sayd Crofords Mate) came with the sayd Bartlett aboard the

and did view and search the same, and upon view thereof did in

Company advise the sayd Bartlett to beare up for some of
the neerest Islands, before hee were too farr gone from

soe leakie that shee was insufficient to proceede home for
England without being amended, which testimoniall being made
the sayd Crofords two men went aboard their owne shipp againe,
and then the sayd Bartletts men thereupon urged the Master to
beare up for the first Christian shoare they could make to whereto the Master
replyed whether would you have mee goe, and the shipps Company then
cryed to the Barbados if wee can fetch it, if not to some of thee
Leeward Islands, (meaning as hee beleeveth Antego or some other of the Leeward

the sayd Bartlett seeing, sayd doe what you will, I will take noe

knoweth that victualls were soe scarce aboard the sayd shipp that the Company
lived upon Potatoe rootes and Cassava bread and Gallevants, and upon
Crabbs which they gathered in the woods in the night tyme, for which reasons
hee verily beleeveth and is perswaded in his conscience that the provisions of
victualls which the sayd shipp Recovery had on board her when shee made for
Antego would not have served her till shee came to England for that when
shee made for Antego she shee was not above two hundred leagues or

HCA 13/72 f.102v Annotate
and after shee had taken in her ladeing appeared to bee very leakie soe that
her company of this deponents sight did pumpe her while shee was in
harbour a hundred and odd strokes every halfe hower
and alsoe before shee went out of harbour caused a thing called a dredge
made with roapes and Okam to be made and stretched under her
the better to stopp her leakes and went to sea therewith, and saith
that after the sayd shipps were put out in Company to sea, upon
the sayd Nynteenth day of November at night fowle weather
happened, by meanes whereof (the Recoveries rigging being badd
and rotten and shee leaky before shee came out) her mayne mast had
was cracked and severall of her sayles splitt and severall of her
shroudes broken, and shee grew thereby more and more leakie, in
soe much that the sayd Tawley and others aforenamed and
the rest of her Company with the assistance alsoe of this deponent who wrought
for his passage, had much a doe with continuall labour at the pumpe
to keepe her above water, and in order to the better coming at her
leakes to stopp them as well as for the present they could, the Master and
Company heaved overboard a parcell of ffustick, but not withstanding
all they could doe, the sayd shipp continued soe leakie that her company
were faine to keepe the pumpe continually goeing, and soe kept
the same goeing severall dayes togeather, in which tyme the shipp
Gilbert coming sometymes within a pretty distance of the Recovery
Mr Croford Commander of the Gilbert did severall tymes call out to
the sayd Bartlett and aske him what cheere howe, and the like, and
was answered by the sayd Bartlett, that his shipp (meaning the
Recovery) was a very leakie shipp, whereupon the sayd Croford
replyed and sayd you were best therefore to beare up in tyme before
you bee to farr gone from the Islands (meaning the Islands that lay
to the leewards) which notwithstanding the sayd Bartlett kept on his
Course with the shipp Recovery and followed the sayd
Crofords shipp severall dayes, by which meanes the sayd shipps
Company by their Continuall labour at the pumpe were very much
wearied and spent and complayned to the sayd Bartlett that they
were soe wearied with continuall pumpeing that they were not able
to hold out, and desyred him to beare up for some of the Islands
that they might there stopp their leakes and preserve the shipp and goods
and their lives, which notwithstanding the sayd Bartlett still continued
on his course after the Gilbert, but at length the sayd Bartlett
wanting candles and other necessaries, went with his longe boate
aboard the Gilbert, but what discourse hee had there with the sayd
Croford hee knoweth not for that hee went not with him, but saith that
the sayd bartlett after a while returned from aboard the Gilbert
and brought with him aboard the Recovery some oyle to burne for light and and nayles

and a bonnett sayle which hee had borrowed of the sayd Croford and
also brought two of the sayd Crofords Company
aboard the Recovery to view the leakes and condition of the sayd shipp,
who at the request of the sayd Bartlett did accordingly make a view
of her and found her soe leakie and insufficient and soe destitute of
tackle and other necessaries that shee was not (as they sayd) in
their Judgment fitt to proceede on her voyage to London without being
first repayred of her leakes and rigging and other necessaries which
shee wanted, and did certifie to that effect under their hands by
a certificate in writing which they gave unto the sayd Bartlett, which
and alsoe told him that they thought it was best for him to beare
up to some of the Islands before hee were gone too farr from them
or to that effect, which done the sayd Crofords two men returned
aboard their owne shipp and the sayd Bartlett still continueing
his resolution to keepe Company with the Gilbert, his Company
told him, that they were soe wearied with pumpeing that they were
not able to continue it longe, and therefore desyred him that hee would
beare up for some of the Islands, as both the sayd Croford and his
men had before advised him to doe, whereupon the sayd Bartlett
answered thus or the like in effect to his company, well, if you cannot
worke any longer in continueing on our Course after the Gilbert, then
make a w[?e]ffe and shoote off a gunne and lett us goe aboard the
Gilbert, but the Company being unwilling to leave the shipp and
goods to perish in the sea, John Bond the Gunner (since deceased)
did lett flye the mayne sheate and an other of the company (whose
name hee remembreth not) bore up the helme, and the whole company
seeing the danger they were in, did by generall consent, make for
Barbados, but could not fetch it, and thereupon made for Antego, and
thereupon the sayd Bartlett seemed to bee displeased presently upon
the bearing up of the helme and makeing towards the Islands, and went
into his Cabin and continued there two or three dayes refusing to
neglecting to take upon him any care of the sayd shipp, but
the shipps Company having with great labour and Continuall
pumpeing brought the sayd shipp within sight of the Islands, the
sayd Bartlett came forth of his Cabbin againe, and tooke upon
him the charge and government of the sayd shipp as formerly, and
helped to sayle her to Antego, whether shee came safe with her
ladeing about the fourteenth or fifteenth day of december 1656 which
was about five or sixe dayes after shee left the Company of the Gilbert
who gave the Recovery one Gunne as a farewell at parting,
And saith that at the arrivall of the Recoverie at Antegoe provisions were
very

very scarce and soe scarce that in this deponents Judgment they could
not have lasted to bring her for England unlesse shee had bin much tighter

shee being when shee made for the Islands and forsooke the Company of
the Gilbert, about eleven hundred leagues from England, and having not
sayled then from the Barbados above two hundred leagues or
thereabout, And saith that after the sayd shipp her arrivall at Antego
her ladeing was there by order of the sayd Bartlett put on shoare
for the better repayreing the sayd shipps leakes and new Careening
of her and the sayd shipp was provided with a quantitie of bread and beefe and fish which they gott from other shipps but alsoe saith that while the sayd shipp soe laye at Antego
her company were soe streightned in allowance of victualls through
want of provision aboard the sayd shipp the bread provided being but till their goeing to sea and poore allowance made them of the other provisions that they did were necessitated
to goe into the woods there in the night tyme and Catch Crabbs which
breede among the rocks in the woods there to releeve themselves and hee this deponent went among

parties to this suite and others of the shipps company did of this deponents sight and knowledge from
the tyme of his this deponents first coming aboard her at Barbados behave them
selves carefully and diligently and take great paines and labour during
the sayd voyage (as this deponent alsoe being a passenger and tyed to labour
for his passage did) and did unlade the sayd shipp Recovery at Antego, and
relade her after shee was repayred, and by such their hard labour
and want of provisions, some of the sayd shipps Company dyed at
Antego, and some other by the way home, by which meanes those which
were left alive were forced in the voyage thense home to worke soemuch
the more to supplye the labour of them that
were dead and saith the sayd Tawley and Company the parties in
this suite and others of the sayd shipps Company with the helpe of this
deponent who wrought as a passenger as aforesayd did sayle the
sayd shipp safe to London where the same with her ladeing arrived

of the shipp and her inability thereby and for want of tackle to performe

their lives would bee in in fullfilling the sayd Bartletts desyre in steereing
for England, did in manner predeposed without the Consent of the sayd

Gravesend upon the flood of tide of ebb, and soe that it was but
yonge flood when shee came to Blackwall, what the shipps that
rode in the river when shee came against Limehouse, were not

the said master (who would needs come up with his vesselle quite
through without stopping contrary to what other shipps use to doe
at that such time of the tide, and contrary to the admonition of this
deponent and his precontest) comming neere the shore, hit or stroke his vessell
upon an anchor, in a dangerous manner, and getting cleere, came
on without stopp to Saint Catherines where hee anchored, and upon
anchoring ran againe upon an anchor, and by such runninge and
striking upon anchors, and comming up in such an undue manner,

were faine to spread a tarpaulin upon the deck to keep the water
from running downe into hold; whereupon the six Brothers
company made a tilt over her that night for feare it should raine
and the goods be wronged by the raines running through the said seames
and saith that that night the lighterman

of rocks and dangerous to any that doe and well know them,

vessells, because greate vessells cannot or but hardly come at them.
And that upon the approach of the said English men of warr and fliboate

seeing noe hopes of escape, ran ashore on the maine, where her
Spanish company leaped out and deserted her, and hide themselves ashore,

after the Unitie and shee soe mett at sea which was in the moneth of
November 1654 (the certaine day hee remembreth not) there happened
a very violent storme which continued for many dayes togeather

November aforesayd and after they had lost the company of the Mathew the sayd Company with the shipp Unitie still holding
on their course for Virginia did discover a shipp at Sea (which as they after=
wards heard was called the hopefull Luke and as they by like report heard
was bound for Yorke River in Virginia, but perished upon the Coast of Bermu=
das by stormie weather) but by reason of the stormie weather which
still continued they could not come neere her, but lost her company soone
after they discovered her, And the Unitie and her company still continueing
their course for Virginia the storme still continued with great furie
and the sea wrought exceeding high by reason of the forcible winde
that blew; and there was alsoe much thunder and lightning and
much snowe and hayle and very tempestious weather in soe much that the
sea often brake in and ranne with great violense into the shipp Unitie
and staved some of her Caske wherein her fresh water and beere was
kept and spoiled a great part of her bread, and most of the shooes (sic) stock[ins GUTTER]
cloathes and bedds aboard provided for the use of the servants of the sayd Jefferies
and Lewellin and alsoe what goods the sayd Moulson had aboard for his
owne Accompt, and the storme continued with soe great violense
that the shipps Company and the servants or passengers expected every
moment that the shipp would sinke, and the Carpenter
or his mate and some others of the passengers and of the Mariners, came
up from betweene decks and sayd the shipp was sinkeing, and this
deponent well knoweth that the sayd shipp was soe bruised and shaken
with the sayd tempest that her forechaynes were washed away and part
of her sheathing, and her mayne chaynes and her bulke heads and
some of her false bonds and other bonds, and some of her standers gave way

the sayd Moulson being desyrous to gaine Virginia if possible still
continued his course thitherwards although the Mariners and alsoe
the passengers did advise him to alter his course and steere
for the next land hee could get to for preservation of the shipp
and goods and his and their lives and their advise not prevaileing with him
but hee still continueing his course for Virginia they at length
seeing their eminent danger they were in, both seamen and passengers
threatened the sayd Moulson to nayle him in his Cabbin and to
carry the shipp to the next convenient Port they could make to in
order to preserve the shipp and such goods as were not allready utterly
spoiled, and their lives, from persihing, whereupon the sayd Moulson
seeing that the storme still continewed and the great danger the shipp
and goods and their lives were in did cause the shipps helme to bee
borne up right before the winde and sea, in order to make for land
and caused the foresayle to be hoysed but before the same was
hoysed cleare up the violense of the winde blew it cleare away
And hee saith that by violense of the sayd storme and the store
of water that brake into the sayd shipp the sayd shipp
had at least five foote water in hold and the Company and passengers
wrought continually at the chayne pumpe to cleere her and with
much paines and difficulty brought her about the tenth of Janu=
ary 1654 English style to Antegoe which was the most convenient place they could
arrive at to save the sayd shipp and such goods as were not
utterly spoiled and their lives and saith that after they were soe come to
Antegoe the Company of the shipp did by reason of the leakiness of
the shipp occasioned by the stormie weather pumpe often, to preserve
as much as they could what goods was on board from further dammage
than what they had receaved at Sea this hee deposeth of his owne sight and

as men could possibly doe or performe, And further

passage for the Barbathos the voyage arlate on or about
the 24th of december 1656 in or about the degree of 24
a greivous violent and outragious storme happned which
continued about five days, and he saith that by reason
of the violence of the sayd storme the shipps side did give
way, and by the raging of the Seas the long boate
of the sayd shipp was staved to peices, And the
Deponent saith that in that extremity and imminent
danger the Company of Mariners of the sayd shipp did
continually pumpe, keeping two pumpes constantly going
and did doe all that could possibly be done in working
and labouring for the preservation of shipp, goods and
lifes, All which were by the blessing of God upon their
endeavours preserved, And further he cannot depose.

To the third article he deposeth that the shipp interrate was in
her homeward bound voyage much overladen, and that by reason
the shipp was soe stuffed with goods the Mariners could not

arlate, and that the long boate of the sayd shipp being
staved to peices as is predeposed, had not any other boate

sayd Crofords order the Company of the sayd shipp
did weigh their anchor, and stood off for the
Sea, untill such time as that the sayd Croford saw
the apparent danger the shipp and goods were in by
reason of his not knowing (as yet) where he was

the Golden ffortune the voyage allegate, and tooke the governement of
the said shipp upon him for the said voyage, of this deponents sight and
knowledge, this deponent being second mate unto him in
the same. And saith that the said shipp the said voyage, from the time
of her issuing or going out of the Gararchicho in the Iland of Teneriff, to
the time of her comming to the an anchor in the Roade of Palma spent
eight dayes space or thereabouts, and went once about the said Iland
of Palma before shee could finde the said roade, And otherwise hee
cannot depose, saving what followeth.

To the fifth article hee saith and deposeth that after the dispatch of the said

Morgan Jonas was by order of the producents Edmund and James Cowse
or their agents (as this deponent was informed) to saile the said shipp
directly to the Iland of Barbada's, but through the unskilfulnes or carelessnes
of the said Jone's the said Iland of Barbado's was overshott by the said
shipp, soe much, that shee was nine dayes or thereabouts more then shee
needed to have bin in gaining and seaking her port in the said Iland
which hee knoweth being his second mate, and going the said voyage in the
said shipp, and as touching the unskilfulnes of the said Jonas, hee saith
hee cannot otherwise depose thereof, than that the observation made from
time to time by the said Jonas of the sun at Noone, was thirtie minutes
or halfe a degree to the Southward of the observation of this deponent and
of William Trutter the cheife mate, who often compared his observation with
this deponents and they still agreed, and found the said Master to be soe much
in an errour, and though they told him thereof, yet still hee persisted
to navigate the shipp according to his owne observation, which being
soe erroneous, this deponent conceiveth that that was the cause of
such his missing his ports and places sought for, and to be longer

this port before her proceeding on the said voyage, namely in or about

meanes the Catherines Company were fayne to hawle them to their shipps side with a roape which
went from the shipp to the Vessell through the sea and then hoist them aboard, and they being [soe GUTTER]
put aboard all wett were stowed upon the shipps O[?u]lopp abaft the mayne mast in a very [safe XX GUTTER]
place and nothing stowed upon them but some loose hempe and bundles of hempe and some few [XXX of XXX GUTTER]
And the same being soe laden the sayd shipp departed therewith from Vado in the sayd moneth of June
and safely arrived therewith at this port of London in the moneth of August last and there delivered them
to the Agents of the sayd Bonnell who disposed thereof according to their will and pleasure, this hee deposeth
being boatswaine and entering the sayd butts in his booke and helpeing to take them in and alsoe
unlade them And further to these articles hee cannot depose./

To the 5th and 6th articles hee saith that for that hee sawe the sayd oyles soe stowed as aforesayd hee knoweth
they were well and carefully stowed and soe as noe dammage could or did happen to them by the de[fault GUTTER]
of the Master or Company of the sayd shipp Catherine or by want of good stowage but what dammage
happened to the sayd oyles, hee verily beleeveth soe happened by the leakinesse and badnesse of the Caske[s GUTTER]
alsoe for that the caske were not drawne over with plaister of parris in the heads of them and usually
Caskes of oyle are, but only drawne with a little resin round about the [XXXds] which melten off in [the GUTTER]
heate of the hold And the sayd butts of oyle before their delivery at the Port of London [were GUTTER]
of this deponents knowledge viewed by two able masters of shipps who tooke a view of their [dammage GUTTER]
at debtford and did upon view made declare in presence and hearing of this deponent and others of the sayd
shipps Company that the sayd twenty seaven butts of oyle were well and sufficiently stowed and
what the dammage which had befalne them proceeded not by ill stowage or by any weighty goods layne
upon them but by the leakinesse and insufficiencie of the Caske And further to these
articles saving his subsequent deposition hee cannot depose./

To the 7th hee saith that upon the arrivall of the sayd Oyles at London there came a Cooper
whose name hee knoweth not who sayd hee was sent aboard to view the sayd twenty seaven
butts of oyle in behalfe of the sayd Bonnell and to receave them from abroad and see
what condition they were And the sayd Cooper having viewed them did finde that
they were all in some measure leakie and but some more than others of them and
did in presence of this deponent and his precontest William Smith acknowledge and
declare that the butts of oyle were all well stowed and that the cause of their l[XXXX GUTTER]
was the badenesse of the Caske, and the sayd Cooper speakeing to the sayd Smith [sayd GUTTER]
lett them bee taken out and put into lighters and I will give you a noate [and GUTTER]
my hand that there is noe fault in the stowage but what dammage is happened is
by the leakinesse of the Caske or words to that effect And this deponent [XXX GUTTER]
remembreth that the sayd Cooper having soe viewed them there were platters and basons sett under the heads of such butts as could bee come at and the Cooper coming
the next morning found that the platters and basons were full and some runne [XXX GUTTER]
oyle that had leaked out in that one night tyme And further hee cannot depose/

To the 8th hee saith for that hee knoweth not how many tonnes of oyle the sayd twenty
seaven butts conteyned hee cannot depose to this article

To the 9th hee saith hee referreth him selfe to the Registry of this Court And
further cannot depose./

To the 10th hee saith hee beleeveth the sayd Young by not receaving his freight is
damnified thereby over and above his principall to the value of twenty pounds sterling
in this deponents Judgment and estimate And further hee cannot depose

the Charterparties for such voyages are made or give order to others to see that the

soe that the Masters cannot have any any (sic) greater avarage then what
is usually paid in such voyages, which average hee verily beleeveth
ought wholly to belonge to the Masters of shipps and their Companyes and not

being Carpenter as a foresayd and aboard the shipp Unitie knoweth that shee
departed from Gravesend upon the voyage in question in the moneth of June
one thousand sixe hundred fifty fower and about the sixteenth say thereof
and after such her departure the sayd shipp mett with contrarie windes which hindred
her soe that it was about the latter end of July or beginning of August
that yeare ere shee arrived in dublin haven And further hee cannot depose
knowing of nothing of of any such promise as is arlate, but knoweth that the sayd
shipp went to Ireland on purpose to take in servants for Accompt of the
arlate Jefferies and Lewellin to be thence transported to Virginia./

To the 6th article of the sayd allegation hee saith that at the arrivall of

provided by the sayd Jefferies and Lewellin or their factors or Agents there
to be shipped aboard her for Accompt of the sayd Lewellin and Jefferyes to
goe the voyage in question, And this deponent knoweth that thereupon the
sayd Moulson did imploye a Joyner who lived at dublin (his name this

Accompt of the sayd Jefferyes and Lewellin and by that meanes did

three and fiftie persons men and women two men of which [XXXX GUTTER]

continued in dublin haven, and an other (a woman) was suspected by the

the passengers servants who were to goe the sayd voyage that rather then shee
would goe the sayd voyage the shipp should never departe from dublin soe
longe as there was a whole block remayning in her or words to that effect

goe out to Sea upon the voyage in question and that soone after they had
weighted Anchor the mayne Jeere block though strongly bound with Iron brake
to peeces soe that by meanes thereof the mayne yard fell downe and the shipp
was forced to come to Anchor againe, and alsoe this deponent heard severall
of the passengers servants in the sayd shipp saye that shee alsoe told them that
though shee went not, yet they should not gett to Virginia that voyage nor
to the Barbados, but should suffer great extremities at sea but should gett
at length safe to Land without losse of life, or to that effect, for which reasons
shee was suspected by the Company to bee a witch and was thereupon by
consent of the Master and company turned ashoare at dublin as
feareing shee might prove dangerous and preiudiciall to the sayd voyage
soe that the number of servants or passengers which remayned aboard at
the shipps departure from dublin were about fiftie persons And further
to this article hee cannot depose./

To the 7th article hee saith hee being Carpenter as a foresayd knoweth that many deales were
Cutt out while the shipp arlate lay at dublin and in her voyage to make cabbins
and bulke heads for the conveniences of the servants passengers in the sayd
voyage this hee the better knoweth for that hee being carpenter cutt the
sayd deales and made the sayd cabbins and bulke heads with the assistance
of his mate, but what number of deales were cut hee remembreth
not but saith there were none of them used by the sayd Mouldson for his
owne private use soe farr as hee this deponent knoweth or remembreth
and further hee cannot depose/

To the 8th and 9th articles hee saith that the arlate Mouldson
and Company after they had receaved the sayd servants aboard as afore=
sayd did with the first oportunitie of winde and weather put out
to sea intending to proceede on their voyage to Virginia (but the certayne
tyme hee remembreth not for that hee this deponent being Carpenter was
busied about doeing things in the shipp usefull for the sayd voyage) And
saith that the sayd shipp was severall tymes by crosse windes put back
to dublin harbour but at length the weather proveing fayre againe sett
forth to sea with intente to goe with the sayd shipp and passengers for Virginia
and having bin some few dayes or some short tyme at sea the winde
blew exceeding hard and the sea was very tempestious by reason thereof
in soe much that by the furie thereof the Boatswaine of the sayd shipp
was washed off from the forecastle thereof and perished in the sea
and the foresayle of the shipp was blowne away and her company had
much a doe to preserve the mayne sayle from being blowne away
And further to those articles hee cannot depose./

To the 10th hee saith that hee remembreth that after the Boatswaine was
soe cast away and the Unitie had lost her foresayle shee notwithstanding
continued on her course for Virginia and in such her course mett with
the shipp whereof the arlate Mr ffox was Commander (whose name as
hee well remembreth was the Margarett and not the Mathew, and the better
remembreth her name to bee soe for that hee wrought on board her after
her coming to Antego the sayd voyage) and saith that shortly after
the Unitie soe werr with the sayd ffoxe his shipp (the tyme more certainly
hee
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.187v Annotate
hee remembreth not) there happened a very great and violent storme
which continued for many dayes togeather by meanes whereof the
Unitie and the sayd ffoxes shipp were separated the one from the other
and lost each others company and sawe one an other noe more till the sayd
ffoxes shipp arrived at Antego, where shee came in for safety and
preservation, though shee were bound for James River in Virginia
the place the Unitie was alsoe bound to if shee could have gotten thither
And further to this article hee cannot depose./

To the 11th 12th 13th 14th and 15th articles hee saith that after the Unitie had
soe lost the company of the sayd ffox his shipp the sayd Moulson and Company
did discover at Sea an other shipp (which they afterwards understood was
the hopefull Luke arlate and bound alsoe for Virginia where shee never arrived
being cast away as they afterwards heard upon the coast of Bermudas) but by reason of the stresse of
weather within few dayes lost the sight of her againe And the Unitie she
continueing her course for Virginia the storme encreased more and more
and was alsoe accompanied with much snowe hayle thunder and lightning
and the sea wrought exceeding high and often brake into the sayd
shipp Unitie notwithstanding all endeavour that could bee used by her
Master and Company to prevent the same and by that meanes the bedding of
the passengers and Company and the passengers cloathes which were packed
upon caske and other the goods aboard the sayd shipp were
and the bread and other provisions of the shipp were much damnified
by wett rewards by reason of the seas breaking in, and some of the
Caske wherein the provisions of beere and fresh water were kept were
staved soe that the Company and passengers were in much want thereof
and much straightned in their allowance and soe violent the storme
was and continued soe longe that by reason there of the shipps company
were forced continually to worke at the Chayne pumpe to preserve
her from sinkeing and soe wrought constantly at the pumpe day and
night till shee gott to Antego (which happened in the moneth of January
one thousand six hundred fifty fower English style) And hee well
knoweth being Carpenter as aforesayd that with the violence and
long continuance of the sayd stormy and tempestious weather the sayd
shipp Unitie was soe exceeding battered and shaken that most of
her bonds, and her standers gave way, and her mayne knee gave
way about seaven or eight inches from the stemme and the stemme
gave way from the upper workes the butt ends of the plankes of the
shipp started and gave way and her wayles, and her beames, wrought
to and fro, and the Oakeham wrought out of her seames, and the
forechaynes of the shipp were washed away to the great endanering
of the losse of the foremast and part of the sheathing and some of
the false bends of the sayd shipp were alsoe washed away and
notwithstanding the sayd shipps being kept with continuall pumpeing
by reason the sea often brake in and shee shipped much water, shee had
once five foote water in hold, and this deponents mate (being in
hold with this deponent and others) ranne up out of the hold and told the sayd
Master the shipp was a sinkeing and the company and passengers
desyred

HCA 13/72 f.188r Annotate
desyred the sayd Moulson that in respect of the danger of the shipp and
her goods and the lives of her Company and passengers hee would make for
the next port that could bee gotten to but the sayd Moulson being desyrous
still to goe to Virginia if possible did still stope his course thitherwards
and the storme still continueing and the company being much wearied
with pumpeing they did at length threaten the sayd Moulson to nyale
him up in his Cabbin of hee would not alter his course and
make for some other port whoch they might gaine with more safety
than to Virginia Where and sayd they would themselves carrie
her to some other port neerer hand whereupon the sayd Moulson seeing
1his Company and the passengers soe desyrous to make to the next port
they could conveniently gett to and knowing that they were unskillfull
to get to any port did saye that hee knew their unskillfullnesse to
bring her to any port and that therefore hee was contented to alter his
course though hee had a great desyre to have gone to Virginia, and
soe for safety of the shipp and goods and their lives sett sayle
for Antego and there arrived with great labour of the company and
passengeres in continuall pumpeing in the moneth of January
aforesayd 1654 English style. And further to these articles

her arrivall at Antego shee was utterly unfitt to goe thense upon the
Island of Antego for fower moneths after his comming thither and
in that tyme visiting most of the places upon the sayd Islands knoweth
that there was but one shipp Carpenter beside this deponent there to
bee had, and that materialls such as the sayd shipp Unitie wanted
ebing soe much and in soe severall wayes damnified by the sayd
stormes as shee was, were not there to bee gotten to fitt her for her
voyage to Virginia, And further hee cannot depose for that hee was
not present at the view made nor knoweth what returne the viewers
made in writeing thereupon, but saith hee this deponent and the rest
of the sayd shipps company did certifie under their hands the
insufficiencies of the sayd shipp to proceede on her voyage to Virginia
and did take their oathes before the foresayd Christopher Kennett
Esquire the then Governor of Antego of the truth thereof, and utterly
refused before the sayd Governor to goe any further to Sea in her unlesse
shee could bee repaired, which hee this deponent is confidently assured
for the reasons aforesayd could not there be done./

To the 19th 20th and 21th hee saith hee knoweth that after the sayd shipps arrivall at

To the 22th hee saith that for the reasons aforesayd hee knoweth the
Unitie could not bee repayerd at Antego and soe the sayd Moulson
was forced to leave her there but what hee made of her hee knoweth

shipps by reason of the heate will unavoidably take in some water

deponent and the rest of the shipps Company expected howerly that
they and shee and her ladeing would have perished in the sea and soe greate
the force thereof was that it caused her seames to open and prove leakie
during the storme, and take in much water into her hold by her leak[inesse GUTTER]
in the sea and the winde was soe violent that it kept the shipp downe in
the water on the starr board side whereby shee shipped much water from

this deponent and other watermen who plye thereabout being much
annoyed and hindred by the sayd vessells their lyeing there in that manner
have spoken severall tymes to the Masters and Companyes of them to
make way that such watermen as had occasion to plye there might have
free passage to Saint Katherines stayres, and upon their obstinasie and
refusall soe to doe have threatned them that if they would not make
waye as they ought to doe in that case, they would cut their hawsers And

Interrogatories saith as followeth.

To the first Interrogatorie hee saith hee well knew the vessell the Endeavour
interrogated (of which John Welch was Captaine) and a certaine
shallop called the Mary, whereof Nathaniel Stakely was commander,
And saith the said vessell whereof the said Welch was Captaine, was of
the burthen of fiftie tonnes or thereabouts, and had and carried eight greate
gunns at the time of her losse hereafter mentioned, and that the said
Shallop was of the burthen of eighteene tonnes or thereabouts and had
foure gunns, and further that both the vessells were at the time of
their surprizall hereafter mentioned very well and plentifully furnished with
all manner of provisions, tackle, furniture and apparell for their
voyage, and in
particular the said greater vessell had two sutes of sailes, three anchors,
three cables, and all other things necessarie, and soe had the lesser of
the said vessells, saving that shee had but one sute of sailes. And saith
the said two vessells with their provisions, tackle, apparell and
furniture, were in his estimation worth a thousand pounds sterling, and
soe much they stood their owners in upon their setting out, but hee
cannot valew them apart, The premisses hee deposeth being masters
mate of the said greater vessell, and sailing in her in company of the
Shallop aforesaid.

To the second Interrogatorie hee saith that William Russell and Erasmus
Bedlow of london both English men and subiects of this Common
Wealth and well knowne to him this deponent were the owners of the said
two vessells and fitted, furnished and sett them out on the voyage wherein
they were lost (as hereafter is mentioned) namely to goe and saile
into the River of Bremer in the parts beyond the seas. And saith they
had a Commission of Marque from his highnes the lord Protector of

the Commonwealth of England Scotland and Ireland and the dominions
thereto belonging to take the shipps and goods of the king of
Spaine and his subiects, which hee knoweth because hee sawe the
said Commission and saith that by vertue of the said Commission the said two
vessells proceeded from this port on the said designe in or about
May last of his knowledge, going masters mate of the said
bugger vessell as aforesaid.

To the third hee saith that after such their setting out and departuure
from this port, the said two vessells went and proceeded to the
River of Bremen, and came to a place there having on one
side the dominion of the duke of Oldenburg, and on the other
the dominion of the king of Sweden, both in amitie with this State,
and this was in or about the end of the said moneth of May, which
hee knoweth for the reasons aforesaid.

To the fourth 5th. 6. 7. and 8th hee saith that the ffleete of the king of danmarke
came into the said River after the said two vessells came in thither,
and the Generall of the said ffleete commanded the said Captaine
Welch to come aboard him, and the said Captaine went aboard
him accordingly and carried the said Commission with him, this
deponent seeing him take the said Commission and goe aboard the said
Generall, who with the rest of the said fleete well sawe and knew
that the said two vessells wore and carried the English colours
and were belonging to England, and after the said Captaines retourne
aboard his owne shipp, shee and the shallop went further into the River
and were followed by two of the vessells of the said fleete, till the
said two English vessells were come into the dominion of the duke of Oldenburgh
in the said River, and that the Captaine and companies of the said
two English vessells suspecting them the said two danish vessells had
a designe to take them, endeavoured in the night time to hale
their vessells ashoare but the subiects of the duke of Oldenburgh
refused to permit and would not suffer them to hale them ashore,
and thereupon the next morning (being the first of July last)
the said Captaine Welch went ashore accompanied with foure or five
of his men, to know the reason wherefore his vessells
were not permitted in a friends territorie to be haled ashore, but
hee was noe sooner come ashore, but that hee and his said men
were taken prisoners by some of the men of the said two danish
vessells, who had gonne ashore and lay there in ambush. Which
danes having taken him carried him and his said men away, this deponent
from aboard the said bigger vessell (which was neere to the shore)
seeing such seizure and carrying away the said Captaine Welch and
his men by the danes,?whilas other of the danes seized the said boate
wherein the Captaine went ashore. Which being donne some
from one of the danish said vessells, called aboard the said Welches
bigger shipp (wherein this deponent was) and asked them saying

you; howbeit for that time the said English vessell[?s] got from
them and going further up the River, they came to the mouth of another
River that went up to the towne of the duke of Oldenburghs residence
in which river they entred and haled up as farr as they could and as long as they had
water enough, and still they were persued by the danes, and when the
English could carry their vessells now further, but were in danger to be a
prey to the danes who sought to take them, and the said Generall of the
danish fleete comming by land to them, and demanding the delivery up of
their vessells and they denying it, saying they could not doe it without their
Captaines order the said Generall said hee had foure hundred men at [?hount]
and would fetch them and either take or fire them, and soe departed to fetch
them, of which this deponent and the other English aboard
informing their said Captaine, who was againe at libertia, hee
ordered them rather than to be taken by the danes to blow the vesell up,
and this blowing up was on the seaventh day of July last
or thereabouts, And before such blowing up, the said Captaine Welch
accompanied with this deponent and others of his company
went to the duke of Oldenburghs Court to complaine of the violencccce
offered by the danes, and to implore his defence and protection, and the
said Captaine after his admission to the dukes presence, retourned and
told this deponent and others that staid without, that hee could get noe
aide or redresse from the said duke, and therefore hee resolved to blow
up the said vessells rather than that they should be taken by the dames
which accordingly was effected as aforesaid. And after the premisses
this deponent going for Amsterdam to come that way home, there came
a small danish man of warr aboard the Holland vessell wherein this deponent
had imbarked himselfe for the said passage, and tooke this deponent out and
carried him prisoner to Gluckstadt, where hee was close up in
prison and kept prisoner therein [XXXXX]  for the space of eighteene
weekes. And further hee deposeth not, saving three others of the said
English were alsoe carried prisoners by the danes to Gluckstadt and all three
imprisoned in irons in the same prison wherein this deponent was kept.

To the 9th hee saith that if the sais vesells had not bin blowne up, the said
danish Generall would undoubtedly have seized and taken them, and
otherwise hee referrefth himselfe to his foregoing deposition.

To the 10th hee saith the said vessells, tackle, apparell, guns and

the Indeavour and Mary departed with their sayd vessells and went about twenty myles
further up the River into a Creeke or River called the how[?u]d leading to
the Cittie of Oldenburgh and laye there a while whether the

by the authority of the Ri[?p]e Master of Oldenburgh gotten their release from the
danes that had them prisoners) returned with their boate which was alsoe restored,

Companyes and himselfe, and the shipps in the meane tyme went up the river and lay about
a myle and a halfe from the Citty of Oldenburgh, whether the sayd Captaine and trumpeter returned

their sayd shipps from the duke of Oldenburgh and that there was noe hope to escape
being taken by the danes the sayd shipps should bee blowen up which accordingly was
done on or about the seaventh day of July last, after which as this deponent heard
by B?oores who lived neere thereabout some of the Companyes of the said English

others of the Company of the sayd shipps Indeavour and Mary were taken prisoners
afterwards by the danes in other places and carried prisoners to
Gluckstadt And further to these articles hee cannot depose

To the 9th hee saith that if the sayd vessells had not bin blowne up as they were
hee verily beleeveth they would have bin taken by the sayd danish Generall
and the reason which hee soe beleeveth is for that the sayd generall did demand
the sayd shipps of the Companyes of them in manner aforesayd and
threatened to give now quarter to their Companyes and to fyre the sayd shipps if they
refused the delivery of them And further saving his foregoeing deposition hee cannot answere

To the 10th hee saith the Indeavour and her tackle Apparrell furniture
gunnes and provisions at the tyme of her blowing up aforesayd were worth as
aforesayd eight hundred pounds sterling and the Mary and her gunnes provisions
tackle Apparrell and furniture were worth at the same tyme of her blowing up the summe
of two hundred pounds sterling And hee saith that hee this deponent after the
blowing up of the sayd shipps heard some of the duke of Oldenburghs subiects
saye that the gunnes both of the Indeavour and the Mary and their Cables and Anchors were taken up out of the
water and preserved on shoare by the duke of Oldenburghs order
and that some of his subiects did of this deponents sight steale and cut away
the sayles of the sayd shipps and bring them into the City of Oldenburgh
but whether they be saved hee knoweth not And saith that there were about [?seaventy GUTTER]
mariners belonging to the sayd two English shipps at the tyme when they were
soe blowne up And further saving his foregoing deposition hee cannot answere./

To the 11th hee saith the owners of the sayd Vessells are (in his this

To the first article of the sayd allegation hee saith hee hath bin a Mariner
for these thirty yeares last past and hath had the Command of shipps as Master
of them for these eighteene yeares last and more and hath in that tyme
made many voyages from this Port of London to Sain Lucar Cales
Mallega Carthagena and Allecant in Spaine
and Lisbone in Portugall, and to Genoa and Leghorne, Venice, Zant
and Zephanie and most ports in Turkey which places lye some within
and some without the streights mouth, and thereby knoweth that it is
frequent and customary for Masters of shipps who goe to those places to have an allowance
of the laders of a royall plate (which is in English money sixe pence
half penny and better) upon every duckett freight for all strangers goods and
for English goods transported to Spaine three Royalls per bayle
And for goods transported from any of the sayd places in Spaine to this Port of
London three royalls per tonne before firming of bills of ladeing
and sixe pence more pertonne at discharge of them at London And for goods
transported from Ligorne Venice Genoa and Zant (being all within the streights)
to London three [?Julies] per tonne which is about eighteene pence English, before
firming of bills, and sixe pence a tonne more for [?we]igh goods and sixe pence a bayle for fine goods at their discharge at London which
allowances are customarily paid to all Masters of shipps and their
Companyes, by the names of primage and Average, and this is a
thing publique and notorious amongst Marchants and Masters of
shipps and all such as trade at sea And hee this deponent hath had
primage and Average after the rates aforesayd paid to him and his
Company by their laders, and those rates for primage and average have
bin and are soe paid tyme out of mynde as hee hath heard from auncient
Masters of shipps and Mariners, and the reason of such allowance of
primage and Average is to encourage Masters and Companyes to bee
carefull in carrying the goods aboard and well stowing of them and alsoe
to oblige them to pay damage if any happen to their ladeing by their
default in ill stowage or the like And further to this article hee cannot depose/

in tyme by the sayd Painters keepeing the wines soe long before hee brought
them and then bringeing soe many togeather had not tyme to stowe them
to the best advantage for tonnage, but were faine to worke night and day and
did worke night and day to cast out their ballast and make roome for the
stoweing of the sayd wines that soe they might not be in danger of being staved
by lyeing a board unstowed and did soe ply their labourt that whereas fifty
or threescore pipes is the greatest quantitie that shipps doe usually stowe
in a day, the sayd Blake and Company with great labour and Industrie heaved out their ballast and alsoe stowed all the

To the first and second articles of the sayd allegation hee saith that in the
Moneth of November 1654 there came a hundred and odd pipes of wine (but
the odd number hee remembreth not) which wines were sent all upon one day (and
by the arlate Gowen Painter (as hee beleeveth) to be stowed aboard the shipp the
Industrie and there being sich a great quantitie sent togeather and a great many
of them betweene decks and the upper deck as full alsoe as they could bee sett with
Conveniencie of leaving roome to worke in the stoweing of them the arlate
Sydrack Blake and company knowing that soe many being brought aboard
together they lay in great danger of being staved if not speedily stowed did cause
his Company to worke extreame hard day and night and heave out the ballast to
make roome to stowe the sayd wines and by such their extraordinary paines
and labour did not only heave out the sayd ballast but alsoe stowe all the sayd hundred and odd pipes of wine in a day
and a nights tyme whereas the greatest quantitie of wine which is usually stowed
aboard a shipp in one day is not above fiftie or sixty pipes, by meanes of
which haste and speede that was made to stowe the sayd wines (soe many being
brought aboard at one tyme) to prevent the danger of their being staved. hee beleeveth
there was some losse of tonnage in the stoweing of them it not being possible
with such speede to stowe them to the best advantage of tonnage of the sayd shipp
And further to these articles hee cannot depose having lost his papers and noates

the Mallega and Canary tonnage having never bin a voyage to Mallega but hath
heard other seamen who have made voyage to both places saye that the Mallega tonnage
is bigger than the Canarie tonnage, two butts at Mallega being reckoned to a tonne
each but conteyning one hundred and twenty gallons, and the tonnage of the Canaries
hee this deponent knoweth is only two pipes to a tonne each pipe conteyning aonly a  hundred and
twelve gallons at the most And hee verily beleeveth that in case the Industrie did bring
home lesse tonnage then shee ought by agreement to have brought, the sayd hurryeing

ffreighters to the Master and Mariners as belonging to them and not to the Owners

ment to them in respect of the great danger of the voyage both in regard of
the heate of the Country of Brazeele which much endangers their health
as alsoe to oblige them to fight the dutch who are enymyes to the Portug[alls GUTTER]
and also to pay what dammage happens by ill stowage or want of pumping
or other carelessnesse or neglect of the Master and Company of the shipp

which primage Average and Pellidmonage doth properly belongand is usually

as they command, but if any either Master or Mates or other finde
fault with their manner of stoweing they well bee very much displeased

Masters and Companyes of shipps are not to be blamed for the same

that the water that lay above the Kilson of the shipp and in the dennage under the

was for that a pype of oyle was staved at the ladeing of the shipp
which oyle (as they sayd) leaked out and came amongst the ballast and
dennage of the sayd shipp and thereby choaked the shipps pumpe that
it could not voide the water soe well as otherwise it would have done,

for Martinica or Saint Christofers, but saith that the said shipps being
met with by fowle weather and stressie stormes, and her victualls
and beverage failing in her course, the said masters and companies were
forced with them into Santa domingo in Hispaniola in the West India's
in or about October 1653 stile aforesaid, and in the next moneth following or
thereabouts, they as hee saith there sold all such of their said Negro's
as were remaining and died not in the voyage, namely they there
sold three hundred and sixtie Negro's or thereabouts for commodities
of that place and countrey, to be thence transported for Spaine in
Spanish bottomes for their said owners account, and the reason of
such designe of transportation in Spanish bottomes hee saith was
because that dutch shipps were not permitted to lade in those parts,
And this hee saith was and is true and notorious, and very well knowne
to this deponent who went master of the shipp the Yellow Sunn, in
company of the Angell (whereof his said brother was master) and
saw the premisses soe happen and donne.

To the third article hee saith and deposeth that in or about the moneth

they promised this deponent and his said brother (commanders of the
said vessells) that they should have leave to make their retournes

and Lade the said proceed of their said Negro's in their said owne
shipps the Angell and the yellow Sun. But after they had served
their turnes, with such transportation oof their men in the said shipps,
and that the said shipps were retourned to Santa domingo, where the
masters hoped of leave to lade them as was promised, the Governour
and officers were soe farr from making their said promise good,
that they put this deponent and his said brother (masters andcommanders
of the said vessells) in prison, and there detained them prisoners
from May 1654 untill March next following and tooke away their shipps and goods and this
they did upon pretence of the said commanders comming to trade
there with the said shipps without License, And this was and
is true and publique.

To the fourth article hee saith and deposeth that on or about the
eighteenth day of March (new stile) next following the said
moneth of May 1654, and about six weekes before Generall
Penn and the English fleete came to hispaniola (according as
hee hath heard of the time of their arivall there) the Governour
and officers of Santa domingo caused this deponent and his said
brother to be imbarqued in a Spanish frigot and sent them away prisoners for
Spaine, in regard of such their comming (as was by the Spaniards pretended) to trade at Santa domingo, And saith that in their
course of proceeding for Spaine comming to the Westward of the
T[?e]rc[XX]a Ilands they met a fflushing man of warr, which being
of greater strength than the Spanish frigot tooke this deponent out of
the frigot, but with [?consent] of this deponent and of his said brother

his said brother staid still in the frigot to the end to goe to the king [of GUTTER]

procured, (namely libertie for himselfe and sentence of restitution
of both the said shipps and their goods, with license to saile to Santa
domingo with a dutch shipp and dutch men to fetch away the said
shipps and lading.  Which newes ariving at Amsterdam by [?letter GUTTER]
from his said brother, this deponent coming to Amsterdam
to give his owners an account of their voyage, was by them in or
about december 1655 new stile sent from Amsterdam for Cadiz to assist his
said brother, and to buy or freight a shipp for Santa domingo
for the effect aforesaid, and consigned this deponent to John [dorXXX GUTTER]
and Peter Pulla the younger (sonne of the said Peter one of the
owners) both dutch men resident in Cadiz to be by them supplied
with moneys for the ends aforesaid, And this hee saith is true and
publique.

To the fifth article hee saith and deposeth that soone after this deponents
arrivall at Cadiz hee there bought the shipp the Nicholas (now
in question and claimed) of and from Vice Admirall de Rutter, who
was there with a Squadron of Holland men of warr, and [some XXX GUTTER]

peeces of wine, and fiftie aroles of oile for account of the said
owners, (claimers in this cause). ffor which goods and shipp and
gunns, this deponent truely and really paid with moneys received
at Cadiz. And whereas hee had order from the owners for moneyes to
be received of their said factors only for freighting or buying  of a shipp
and this deponents said brother having alsoe gotten license of the king
of Spaine for lading the said wines and oile, this deponent borrowed
a thousand peeces of eight of an Irish merchant or factor there named
Thomas Martin for paying for the said wine and oile, and contracted
with him for repaying him there before his departure, in case his [XXX GUTTER]
order came from his owners in answer to his letters for [XXX GUTTER]
for discharging thereof, before his departure thence, but [?if GUTTER]
the order came not before his departure, it should be secured upon
the said shipp on bottomrie, but saith that about five or six dayes
before his departure thence his order came directed to the said John
dau[?mien] and Peter Poulla (from whom and from david Br[XXX GUTTER]
arlate hee had before received moneys for paying for the shipp and guns
who accordingly advanced the money, and therewith this deponent [?repaid GUTTER]
and dischardged the said Thomas Martin. And further then the said
shipp, guns and goods were bought and laded with the effects or
moneyes advanced upon the account of the said owners, claimers in
this cause. All which hee knoweth for the reasons aforesaid.

To the sixth article hee saith and deposeth that the king of Spaine
sent a person of qualitie called (to his remembrance) the Conde
da [X]elez in the said shipp Nicholas for Santa domingo to goe and be
President at Santa domingo, in place of the other that had donne [XXX GUTTER]

of their said shipps happened in their absence, and after they were sent
away prisoners as aforesaid from Santa domingo for Spaine.

To the seaventh article and schedule hee saith and deposeth that soone after
the arrivall of this deponent and his said brother at Santa domingo

other shipps for which they came soe destroyed and sunck, and noe
likelihood of getting any speedie satisfaction for the same, they

saith that this deponent being advertized of such miscarriage of the

this deponent departed from Lerwick in a shipp bound for London, which

the sayd Robles hath formerly lived in the Canarie Ilands and is

oportunitie of shipping hath offered itselfe at the Canaries (being
an Island) whereby the sayd herrera might send such bills if any
of them remayne unsent in the Mary And Joyce./

that the Phenix did then ride in an ordinary place where shipps usually
ride, and rid there from T[?urs]day till Satterday night without doeing any
dammage to any other shipp  or receaving any from them./

To the 3 article hee saith that upon the Satterday at night or on Sunday towards morning the shipp Consent
did breake one of her Cables by which shee was moored and came
thereby croose the Phenix her hawse and soe lay crosse the same for one
tyde of ebb videlicet about sixe or seaven howers and in that tyme soe farr

did take the shipp Consent from rideing crosse the hawse of the

the layeing the sayd Anchor in that manner would
without doubt cause the Consent to come fowle of the Phenix

crosse the hawse of the Phenix the Phenix Anchors lay North and
south or neere thereabout and saith that if afterward they did lye one more Easterly and
the other more Westerly the same was occasioned by the Consents
comming fowle of the Phenix hawse, and thereby bringing
home the Phenix Anchors, which notwithstanding the Phenex
Anchors were in this deponents Judgment farther off from the

more aboard her but one youth to looke to her, and hee this

Examined upon an allegation given
in on the behalfe of the said English
East Indies Company on the 28th
of October last.

Rp. .1. [X ?reliqui?t]

John Garrard of Wapping in the County
of Middlesex Mariner, aged twenty nine
yeeres or thereabouts, sworne and examined
saith and deposeth as followeth.

To the first article of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth
that for theise nine yeeres space last past hee this examinate as a
mariner hath used the trade of East India, and made three voyages
to those parts from this port of London, and in such voyages hath
frequented the port of Bantam and other places whereunto the
honourable English East India Company use to send their shipps, and
servants, and thereby well knoweth that in the yeares 1655. 1656 and 1657
the Governour and company of the said English Merchants have
used the trade and send their shipps servants and officers to a place in Java
Major called Bantam in the said parts of East India, where hee
saith they have for all the said time had and still have a settled
ffactory, and likewise to send to and to trade at Maccasser, Surat
Jambee and other parts of the said east India and thereabouts. And
saith that at Jambee and Bantam the said English company hath
and imployeth from time to time severall officers and servants
in their trade and commerce as likewise in other places thereabouts
to send thence for England the goods wares and Merchandizes of
the growth manufacture and vent of those parts and places, And
that the said English company have from time to time for all the
time aforesaid freely traded (saving the iniuries hereafter
mentioned) and sent their shipps to Bantam and places aforesaid
and brought them out thence with such goods wares and merchandizes
as they thought good and that were provided for them, as they might
(as hee conceiveth) lawfully doe, and this hee saith was and
is publique and notorious, and observed by him soe to have bin
had and donne as hee hath here deposed.

To the second article hee saith and deposeth that the said East
India Company of England amongst other their shipps and
vessells which they have sent to and imployed in the said parts of
East India and thereabouts, they sent and had there in the yeere
1656 in such their service and imployment the shipps the Endymion
whereof Gervase Couchman was commander, and which after his
death was commanded by this deponent, who while the said
Captaine Couchman lived was his mate the said voyage. The
Marygold, the Golden Cock, the Olive Branch and the
Jonathan, all which shipps this deponent saw in those parts
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.484v Annotate
in the sayd yeere 1656, And saith that neither the said shipp the Endymion
nor any of her company offered any affront, iniury or provocation
to any dutch shipp or shipps that were there at that time, or to any of
the commanders or company of any of them, All which hee knoweth
being first Mate and afterwards commander of her the said voyage
Nor did as hee beleeveth any of the said other English shipps or any
of their company offer any iniury whatsoever to the dutch there.

To the third article hee saith that in the moneth of August last
the said shipp the Endymion (whereof this deponent was then masters
mate) in her voyage from England for Bantam comming into the
Streight of Sundra, did on or about the seaventh day of the said
moneth (old stile) meet in the said Straight a single shipp
appertaining to the dutch [?crussing] too and againe, which said dutch
shipp sailed along with the Endymion till the next day, [?XXX]
they came within sight of Pullapanjan, where foure other
dutch shipps hee saith were rideing, all which upon sight of
the Endymion and the said other shipp weighed and stood to [?XXXX]
and when they were come neere, there came one of their [?sloopes] aboard
the Endymion with command brought by one that was therein, that
the Endymion should come to an anchor by their Generall who
was still riding at Pullapanjan, which the Commander and
company of the Endymion obeyed and sailed along with them an
soe came to an anchor near their said Generall; but the dutch
pretending that the Endymion rode too farr off them, [?XXX]
and commanded the Endymion to be brought to an anchor yet
nearer to their Generall, and this hee conceiveth they did to
show their power and greatnes; upon which command, the
Captaine and company of the Endymion obeying, brought her to
an anchor yet nearer to the said Generall; All which hee
knoweth because hee was present in the Endymion and heard and
saw the premisses soe donne.

To the fourth article hee saith and deposeth that after such second
comming of the Endymion to an anchor neere the dutch
Generall, there came a summons aboard the said shipp Endymion
to come aboard
the said Generall, but the said Captain Couchman not being then
in health, sent his Purser both to excuse his not comming by meanes
of such his indisposition, and to
learne the reason wherefore the said shipp the Endymion and her
company and lading were soe detained, and saith the said Purser [?having]
bin aboard the Generall retourned aboard the Endymion and in this
deponents presence and hearing related that the said generall
had said and declared that hee would not permit the Endymion to
goe
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.485r Annotate
goe into Bantam Roade, nor not soe much as the shipps boate to goe
off to advise the English companies agent if the said shipps arivall,

To the fifth article hee saith and deposeth that the said dutch generall
and shipps kept the said shipp the Endymion in this condition and detention
by the space of nine dayes, at the end whereof the said Captaine
Couchman and company seeing noe hopes that the dutch would alter their [?XXXXX]
sett saile with their said shipp the Endymion for Jambee, at which port
having procured what pepper was there to be had, they set saile back
againe, and comming neere the foresaid place where the said dutch fleete
was lying, there came againe three saile of them out to the Endymion
whose Captaine and company hoped then to have gonne freely
into Bantam and have compleated their tonnage and soe to have sailed
for England, it being now about foure monethes since her departure
from the dutch to goe for Jambee, and the said dutch shipps that
soe came out commanded and constrained the said shipp the Endymion
to come againe to an anchor by their Generall, and commanded
this deponent who was then commander of the Endymion (the
said Captaine Couchman being then deceased) to come aboard and this deponent going
aboard the then Generall of the dutch, was by him strictly prohibited
and forbidden to goe into the Roade of Bantam with his
said shipp, only upon this deponents earnest intreatie the said
Generall (as if hee therein did the English a greate favour) suffered
them to send their boate ashore to give notice to the English Agent
of their being there, And this second stay an detention of the said
shipp the Endymion hee saith was when the said shipp was
come within foure or five leagues of Bantam, and soe farr hee
saith they were constrained to send their boate to goe ashore to advise
the said English Agent as aforesaid, And about the same distance
from Bantam the said [?former] stay and detention of the Endymion
was made, all which hee knoweth being as aforesaid first mate
and afterwards commander of the said shipp the Endymion.

To the sixth and 7th articles hee saith that the Endymions boate having bin
soe ashore retourned with the said English Agent
who accompanied with this deponent went aboard the said dutch
Generall, to whom hee addressed himselfe and intreated him to
permit the said shipp to come into Bantam roade to receive in
such goods as were there in a readines for her, but the said Generall
answered that hee durst not give her leave to goe into the said Roade
without expresse order therein first had from Batavia, or
in words to the same effect, whereupon the said Agent retourned ashore
and about a fortnight after hee retourned againe aboard the Endymion
and acquainted this deponent and other the officers, that hee and the
Counsell
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.485v Annotate
Counsell at Bantam had written and sent letters to the dutch Governour
at Batavia to obtaine leave for the said shipp to come into the said
roade of bantam to the effect aforesaid, and that they had receaved
an answer, purporting a deniall to gra[?nn]t such their request,
whereupon the said Agent hoping that his presence might effect
[?something] suitable to their desires, desired the shipp to be fitted out
to saile to Batavia, which was accordingly donne, and [XXX] that
said Agent and Counsell went to Batavia in the said shipp the
Endymion, and there went ashore to the dutch Governour, ans staid there
ashore about five dayes space solliciting and suing (as they reported
when they came back) to the said Generall for leave as aforesaid,
but all in vaine, for hee was soe farr from condescending to such
their reasonable request (as they repeated) that hee told them that
they should neither goe in with their shipp nor soe much as send in
their boate to Bantam, whereupon the said agent sent word a[?board GUTTER]
to this deponent, to acquaint him that there was nothing to be done
and therefore hee this deponent and company must [XXXX GUTTER]
themselves and shipp for a homeward voyage, upon which this deponent
wrote back to the Agent that they could not soe doe through want
of victualls, whereupon the Agent (as hee afterwards related when
hee came aboard) applied himselfe againe to the Generall an
acquainted him with such their want, and that with much adoe
the said dutch Generall had condescended that the Endymion
should have five dayes time to provide her selfe with water
and [?ryse], and soe to be gonne, and that after that space they should
have noe leave to goe or send their boate ashore, and soe with
a very small proportion of victualls (for there was none
to be gotten by them at Battavia) the said shipp Endymion was
forced to retourne for England with very much dead freight,
to the greate dihonour (the premisses considered) of the English
nation, the hazard of the voyage, and greate dammage of the said
English East India company, in being forced to leave their goods behinde, which are
like to lie there and perish, The premisses hee deposeth being then
(as aforesaid) commander of the said shipp the Endymion.

To the 8th hee saith that while the said shipp Endymion soe [?lay GUTTER]
the first time under the detention of the dutch, upon such her
first arrivall, Captaine Couchman sent out his boate with
some  of his company to goe to a little adjacent [XXXXXX GUTTER]
Iland to cut a little wood, but the dutch to magnifie their [?power GUTTER]
and show their greate Imperiousnes, fired a gun at the said boate,
and forced the boate aboard their shipp, where the English were
constrained to aske them leave soe to goe and fetch a little wood and
for their [XXXXXXXXX] firing, otherwise they must have retourned
with out any wood for such their use, all which hee knoweth because
hee saw the same soe donne.

To the 18th hee saith that during all the times aforesaid and when the
said shipp Endymion suffered the foresaid affronte and iniuries from the
dutch, shee wore the English colours, and well knowne to and noted
by the dutch to be an English vessell, and to be belonging to the
English East India company, and the said shipps that did the
said Iniuries and affront were all dutch shipps, of which the
Generall was named the Erasmus, and were in all when the

Endymion there first arived the said voyage fourteene innumber

the said fleete of dutch shipps were uner the Command of
Generall Schouten, and when shee soe came back from Jambee
they were under the command of General Lilly both dutch men and
in the service and imployment of the said dutch East India Company.

Jonathan Lee of Ratcliff in the County of Middlesex
Mariner, aged 36 yeares ir

To the first hee saith and deposeth that for all the monethes
in the yeares 1655. 1656. and 1657 arlate and Longer, namely for
theise twelve yeares last past of his sight and knowledge The
Governpour and company of English Merchants trading to East India

thence to send for England the goods, wares and merchandizes of the
growth, manufacture and vent of that countrey and those places
All
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.486v Annotate
All which hee knoweth for that hee for the said twelve yeares last
hath as a Mqariner used the said trade of East India, and
in that sopace made foure voyages thither, and frequented the said
factories and places, and thereby alsoe well knoweth, that the said
Companies shipps have freely gonne and come to and from their said factories
with their lading for all the said time (saving the injuries hereunder
mentioned) And saith the premisses were and are publique and
notorious, and theref there hath bin and is a publique voice and
fame.

To the second article hee saith and deposeth that within the said yeeres
1655 and 1656 and monethes therein respectively concurring the said
Gouvernour and Company of English Merchants trading to East India sent
diverse of their shipps to those parts, which arived there in
safetie, and that they had at the said East Indies and parts
thereabouts in the said time the shipps the Endymion (whereof
first Gervase Couchman and after his death John Garrard
was commannder) The Marygold, the Golden Cock, the
Olive-branch and the Jonathan, all which hee this deponent saw
there within the said time, and credibly heard that the shipps the
Beniamin and Assada Merchant were alsoe then there, and in
the Endymion and Golden Cock this examinate sailed, and
thereby knoweth that neither of them or any of their company
or commannders, nor as hee beleeveth any of the said other shipps
offered any injurie, affront or provocation to any dutch shipps
or their commanders or any of their company that were in
those parts at that time.

To the third and fourth hee cannot depose, for this deponent came
out into the said shipp Endymion that voyage, till her comming to
Jambee.

To the fifth article hee saith and deposeth that hee being at
Jambee, saw the arivall thither of the said shipp the Endymion in the
voyage arlate, where hee saith shee tooke in what pepper shee
could get, which being donne shee set saile for Bantam, neere
unto which place (as her company reported) shee had bin before that
her comming to Jambee, but was not permitted to goe in, and
saith hee this deponent came passenger in her from Jambee
and thereby well knoweth that when she came neare the dutch
fleete, which was about nine saile, and rode about foure
leagues off Bantam, shee was commannded to come into the
said fleete and to come to an anchor neere the dutch Generall
whose name as hee remembreth was the Heer Lilly, and the said
shipp Endymion obeying came accordingly to an anchor, and [?there]
hee saith some of the dutch shipps that
had
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.487r Annotate
had weighed came to an anchor neare to and about the Endymion in
such manner as they had inclosed her, and secured her from weighing
and sailing without their permission, and then hee saith it being
made knowne to the dutch Generall that the said shipp Endymions
commannder (who then was the said Garrard) and company desired
to saile her to Bantam to compleate her ronnage to goe for England,
the said Generall prohibited such her going into Bantam Roade,
but with much adoe, gave leave for her voate to be sent ashore, to
give notice to the English Agent of her being there. All which
hee knoweth because hee was aboard the Endymion the said time.

To the sixth and 7th hee saith that the said English Agent thereupon came
from Bantam, and went aboard the said Generall, to get leave for
the said shipp the Endymion her going into Bantam-roade to take in
such goods as were there ready for her to be transported for England,
but as the said Agent reported upon his retourne, the said dutch
Generall would not permit her to goe thither, And thereupon the
said Agent after hee had bin some space ashore at Bantam came aboard the Endimion willed the Captaine and company to fit the shipp and to
weigh and to saile for Battavia, where hee hoped that his
presence might (as hee said) effect somewhat with the Governour
of the dutch, [?rendering] to his desires, and thereupon the said shipp
sailed thither, and there the said Agent went ashore, to applie
himselfe to the Governour, but afterwqards there came word from
the said Agent, that hee could not prevaile with the Governour
for the said shipps foing for Bantam, and thereupon the said Captaine
and company were constrained with a very small quantitie of
victualls, to set saile for England, the dutch not giving them
time to stay to furnish themselves with such conveniencie of food for
their maintenance and subsistence, as was necessarie for that voyage.
By meanes of which premisses hee saith the said voyage was
much disappointed, the shipp forced to retourne with much dead freight.
the goods that were provided and readie for her lading at
Bantam left behinde, the said English company very much
damnified, and the English Nation dishonoured. All which hee
knoweth for the reasons aforesaid.

To the eighth hee saith that while the said shipp the Endymion
soe lay under commannd of the dutch fleete about foure leagues
from Bantam as aforesaid, the Captaine sent out his boate
with some of his company therein to cutt a little wood upon
an uninhabited Iland that was neere by, but the dutch (as
hee saith) to show their power and greatnes in those parts
fired a musket at the boate, and commannded her aboard the
Generall, to crave leave for such their going and fetching
of wood, which they were constrained to doe, or els they must not
be suffered to goe ashore to fetch any wood, and as hee heard they had fired a Gun at her boate when shee was there before. And otherwise hee cannot
depose.

To the 9th hee saith that the shipp the Mary gold arlate
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.487v Annotate
was riding before Battavia when the said shipp Endimion
soe came in thither, and while they were both soe there, the
Cabinets or Scrittors of the English Agent Mr ffrederick Skinner
were by order of the dutch Generall (as it was there commonly
and generally spoken and reported) seized upon and fetched from
aboard the Marygold, and that (as it was alsoe commonly said)
there were many of the English East India Companies Papers and letters
of greate moment then in the said Scrittors, which were lookt into
and perused by the dutch, to the great discovery of the secrets
and matters much importin the said English companies trade
and commerce in those parts, and greate dammage of the
said cmpany. And further to this article hee cannot depose.

To the tenth article hee saith and deposeth that within the
said time, namely in or about december last was a twelve moneth
a small vessell named the Golden Cock, in the service and imployment
of the said English Company or some of them, having in
India procured her lading of pepper to transship aboard
another of the said Companies shipps named the Imployment,
the dutch (having notice thereof) manned out a vessell
of 20 gunns, to surprize her, and to take the pepper from
aboard, but by Gods Providence, missed of their designe
therein; And that they had soe manned out the said bessell
to take the Pepper away from the Golden Cock, this examinate
heard some of the dutch themselves afterwards confesse at Bantam
and say that they missed of the Golden Cock, and seemed

wasted the Island of Poleran arlate because the English were to
have it againe. [?yea] hee saith it was by many said and
reported that the ducth were soe studious to make an absolute

English, that not content with having soe laid it wast, they
caused the ashes of a certaine tree to be scattered and strewed
up and downe in the places thereof that were most
fertile for the growth of nutmegs, which ashes hee saith are said
to be of such nature and qualitie, that nothing will grow
where they are s[?p]red or strewed, And further saith that
formerly this deponent having speech and discourse with
the Generall of the dutch before Bantam, and this
deponent telling him that hee gheard that they had blowne up

in peeces, and commanded them to come by the Lee, to which
this deponent answered, that hee would soe doe, if they

the said Captaine and company would be civile, but they still persuing
and thretening with greate violence and fiercenesse, and hearing noe
reason, this deponent taking up his sword as if hee meant to stand
upon his iust defense, the said headmost shipp fired a
volley of small shott at this deponent as hee soe stood upon the poope
and forthwith clapt the Beniamin aboard and fired into her a whole
broad side as hee conceived, most of the guns double shotted
which tore the Beniamin and rigging exceedingly and wounded seaven
of her men, some of them very desperately, and this hee
saith was at least two leagues (in his iudgement) from any fort or
castle, yet notwithstanding the said shipp that soe first assaulted the
Beniamin, endeavoured to grapple and make fat to her, but
the graplings slipping, the said shipp spooned away from
the Beniamin, which by that time clearly perceiving them to be
Hollanders, this deponent called out, and desired them to forbeare
and told them hee would presently come to an anchor, but
immediately the sternemost shipp being come up and upon the
Beniamins [?weather] quarter, commanded her to beare off to
sea, and by this time the other shipps boate being come aboard
and endeavouring to cutt the Beniamins anchors fron the Bouyes, and
to cutt and mangle her rigging, somwhat distracted this
deponent and company, who yet (assoone as they could) hald up
their sailes and let drop their anchor, But the company
that was in the said boate, not being herewith content,
forced this deponents companie to strike the Beniamins flagg,
and proceeded further to abuse them by words and actions, and taking
things out of the shipp. Whereupon (they commannding this
deponent to come aboard to their Captaine) this deponent
to satisfie them, and praying them in the meane while to be quiet
went aboard with them in their boate not having his owne
readie, And being come aboard the said shipp that
soe came first up, the Captaine entertained him soe coursly
that in stead either of hearing this deponent, or giving him
any account of the said violence (which this deponent desired) seized him
presently prisoner and would not suffer him to retourne, although
this deponent entreated him to take what account hee should
demand of him, and cleare him if hee had nothing to say against
him, which hee denied, and in stead thereof sent and fetcht aboard
this deponents cheife marchant, cheife mate, and severall others of
his men, and put his owne men aboard this deponents said
shipp, commanding her and keeping her as a prize. And
this deponent being aboard and soe used, and desiring to know the name
of the said shipp that soe came first and upon which this deponent was soe
commanded aboard and kept prisoner, said that his name was Jacob
Swart, and that his shipp was named the Mars of Middleborow
and that the said other shipp was named the Zierickesea of fflushing,
and that her commander was named daniel da Prieza, and that
they were both belonging to the dutch or Netherland East India Company, and
soe much the companie of the said shipp likewise frequently said and
acknowledged
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.493v Annotate
acknowledged, And further saith that the premisses being soe done
the said dutch Captaine of the said shipp that came first up, namely
Captaine Swart, sent away his boate to Vingerla to advise the
Vice Admirall or commander of the fleete, of the said seizure
kept the said shipp Beniamin under the [?same] from the said thirteenth to
the eighteenth of the said moneth of November 1656, in which time this deponent
often treating with the said Captaine Swart, and instigating him to cleare  [?him]
with his shipp, goods and company, and not prevailing, did by word
of mouth protest to and against him of demanding satisfaction for
all dammages that [?had] or should happen for and upon the said [?former]
assault and seizure, whereof hee made slight, and told this deponent
expressely and plainly, that had his grapnell held, hee
would have prevented him from telling of tales, by cutting him
and his company all off. And further saith that on monday the
seaventeenth (old stile) of the said moneth of November, the commander
in cheif of the said dutch fleet comming in the shipp Gousa with [?seaven]
shipps from Vingarla (which is about twenty leagues to the Northward[X ?of]
Goa) f[or] Goa, and comming before the barr of Goa where the said two
shipps then were, came to an anchor, and the next morning
commanded this deponent and his said cheife merchant aboard
to give him an account of their busines, and they goeing aboard
gave him an account (as they had donee the said dutch Captaine [?alsoe]
before) that they were English and that they came from fort Saint [?XXXX]
with the Beniamin belonging to English members of the East India company,
bound for Surat, and told him withall how they were set upon by
the said two shipps and declaring unto him all the passages of the
busines, and desired him to consider what
hee would with them, and to resolve shortly, for the longer
they were detained, the greater would be the dammage of
which they did and would protest, To which the said commander
made answer that hee had received a relation of a contrary
tenor from the dutch that were in the action, howbeit hee
was very [XXXXXXX] had passed, and desired that they might
part friendly, only hee insisted that this deponent should give
satisfaction for the dammage which as hee said the Mars received from [?some]
guns which this deponent had shott from the Beniamin,
but this deponent making answer (as hee saith the truth was
that hee made noe shott at all but
in the necessarie defence of himselfe company and shipp, and
after the said dutch shipp had poured the said broad side into [?her]
and therefore hee could not be liable to any satisfaction, but
should looke for satisfaction for the wrong donne to him and
his principalls, the said commander at length desired hee
might part friends upon an even account, only hee
demanded of this deponent that hee would give under his hand
that they had donne him noe wrong, which this deponent
scrupling, but perceiving, and being plausibly told that
otherwise hee should not be cleared, nor his shipp, hee to get[?t]
the libertie of him selfe, shipp and companie, subscribed
some writing which they drew and tendred him tending to that
propos[?al], though the truth of the storie was alltogether
according to the foregoeing relation. And saith the dutch
tooke
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.494r Annotate
tooke by force foure Portugueses souldiers out of the Beniamin while shee
was under the said restraint, which souldiers Agent Greenhill had put
aboard to be landed any where on the coast of India, they
having bin upon articles [XX fXXX] by the dutch as their taking of Calumba
in the Iland of Ceilon. And when at length this deponent was
cleared, hee desired leave of the said commander in cheife, that
hee might send in a boate to an English shipp belonging
to his principalls then riding in the port of Goa, to  give her
advise of his proceedings and being there, but the said Commander
would ot give leave but flatly denied the same, although this
deponent offered that one of his men should goe alonge and sea that
his boatewent only to that shipp, and not ashore, and should heare
that hee did not send any intelligence what [?soever] to their
preiudice. And further hee deposeth not, seeing that
severall times while this deponent soe remained prisoner, the
f[?iscall] of the said dutch fleete dealt with and persuaded
this deponent to subscribe with his hand to a note which hee the
said [?ffiscall] had prepared, purporting, that this deponent and
company absolutely tooke the said two men of warr to be ffranch man (sic)
and that they endeavoured to goe under the refuge of the forts,
without taking notice that they proved to be dutch men,
or what ensued as aforesaid, which this deponent refused to signe,
telling him hee would adhere to the truth of the matter as
it happened and as hee had declared, being as aforesaid.

To the nineteenth hee saith that by the foresaid hostile actions,
seizure and detention of the said shipp the Beniamin by the dutch,
besides the dishonour redounding to this nation, the owners and
imployers of her have suffered much losse and dammage, and in
particular hee estimateth the losse redounding to the
owners of her (all English man and subiects of this nation) by
the shattering and tearing of the shipps hull tackle and
furniture by the said shooting of the dutch, and by their rifling
the seamans goods and clothes, to the summe of one hundred pounds
sterling, and by hindering and not permitting her to goe or send
to the said English shipp lying in the port of Goa, named the
hopefull frigot (being in the same service that the Beniamin was),
and which had salt peter and pepper and other goods aboard provided
to be put aboard the Beniamin, which the Beniamin was not
suffered to receive, hee estimateth the dammage therein redounding
to them a summe of six hundred and thertie pounds sterling more
which shee would have made or gained for the freight of them, and
by soe longe the Hopeful frigots staying at Goa; and the Beniamins staying soe
longe for her at Surat, caused the Benaimin to stay soe long in
India that shee lost her passage gome for that season
being six monethes losse of time, which hee estimateth in p[XXXX]
of dammage and losse to the said owners at two hundred and
fiftie pounds per moneth sterling, amounting for the six
monethes to fifteen hundred pounds, Moreover through her
said long stay (occasioned by the said seizure and violence) shee
off
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.494v Annotate
off the cape de Bonne Esperance met with such violence
and fowle weather that beate and dammaged her
and the goods aboard to the valew or summe (for the said dammage) of
sixe hundred pounds. Moreover that the freighters or imployers
(members of the said company) lost and were by losse of marke[?et ?an]
deterioration of their goods, and delay of the retourne of
the said shipp with their goods in time [XXXXXXXXX] and otherwise
by the said assault and detention by the dutch, endammaged in
his estimation to the summe of five thouand pounds sterling,
and for preventing her taking in the
goods out of the Hopefull frigot which were designed for her
and which are still detained in India, hee iudjeth them to
be endammaged to the summe of one thousand pounds
sterling more. Adding that the said Hopefull frigot seeing
the greate abuse soe donne by the dutch to the Beniamin
durst not come out of the port of Goa (as hee understood)
through feare of ill usage alsoe by them, and soe
the Benjamin was forced to stay longe in vaine at Surat
expecting her. And further hee cannot depose.

knoweth that the said shipp sailing from ffort Saint George

overpowered, shee became subued by them, and they made themselves
masters of her and her company, and commanded and received the
said Captaine Browne and his cheife mate and cheife merchant
prisoners aboard their said shipp that soe first came up. And
saith that then the Captaine an company of the Beniamin fully
found and understood that the said two shipp (being man of warr) were
dutch and were belonging to the East India company of the
United Netherlands, and that shee which soe came first
was named the Marrs, commanded by one Captaine Smart, and
that the other wa named the Zierickesea, and that they were
soe, this deponent hear severall of their companies say and
acknowlege, And saith that after the said shipp Beniamin had bin
about five dayes under the said seizure by the said dutch, and
was with much adoe released, the said Captaine Browne made
meanes to the Commander to get leave to goe or send into the
port of Goa, to advise the Hopefull frigot (an English shipp
which was there and was in the service of his principalls) of
his being there with the Beniamin, but it was denied him, and
soe hee and company were faine to goe next wayes to Surat,
and there [?longe] to expect the comming thither of the Hopefull frigot,
which had Pepper and Salt Peter aboard which was to be from her
transhipped into the Baniamin to be brought for England, and
by this violence and seizure of the Baniamin by the said dutch
shipps, and their hindering her to speake with or give advise
to the Hopefull frigat, shee was soe long detained and
delayed that shee lost the time of the yeere for retourne,
and was forced to be six monethe longer upon her
voyage than otherwise shee (in all probabilitie) would have bin
to the greate losse and dammage of her owners and imployers
Englishmen, subiects of this Commonwealth, and members of the
English East India company, all which hee knoweth being gunner
of her and going all the voyage in her, and saith that the
Beniamin when the said two dutch ships soe came up and assaulted
her, had the English colours abroad and faire to be seene, and
they well knew and unerstood her to be an English shipp, and
manned with English when they soe came up, and yet
notwithstanding they committed the wrong and violence predeposed.

To the nineteenth article hee saith and deposeth that by the said
battering and tearing of the shipp the Benjamin by the shouting of
the dutch as aforesaid her owners have sustained dammage to the
summe of one hundred pounds sterling in his estimation, and for her
delay and hinderance of time by them being six monethes in his iudgment
hee estimateth their losse and dammage to be one thousand pounds, and
for losse of freight of pepper, Peter, and other goods which shee should
and would have taken in (more than shee did) if shee had not bin soe

To the nineteenth article of the said allegation hee saith hee
very well knoweth the shipp the Endimion allegate whereof
Gervase Couchman was late commander and was aboard
her immediately before her proceeding from the downes on the
voyage in question, wherein hee knoweth shee sailed in
the service and imployment of the English East Indiea
company who were her freighters, and saith shee was
dispeeded out of the downes on the said voyage on or about
the third day of ffebruary Anno 1655 with order from the
said companie to saile for Bantam, where shee was by the said
companies order to take in her lading of pepper, sugar and other goods,
which were proper for sale at Surat, and with the same to proceed for
Surat, where by the same order shee was with the proceed thereof to take in such goods as were
propper for the markets of Europe, and therewith to retourne for England,
and that as hee by letters and dispatches from those parts (which hee hath
seene) and otherwise bin informed and beleeveth the said shipp Endimion
arived before Bantam in August 1656 but was not by the dutch
permitted to enter that port, whereby the designe was wholly
frustrated, and the dammage thereby redounding to the companie
very greate, for hee saith it is very probable and hee is fully
perswaded that the agent and therest  of the Companies factors would
at Bantam and thereabouts have laded a cargo of pepper and other goods upon the said shipp, which
would in all probabilitie have amounted unto about thirtie thousand
Rialls of eight, and according to the said companies order have dispeeded
her for Surat, where they might in their sale (according to former markets)
have produced about 50 per cent profit which would have amounted to the summe of about
fourtie five thousand Rialls of Eight, which summe of about fourtie
five thousand Rialls of eight, if it had bin invested in goods
procurable in and about Surat, as Callico's, Indico's and other
goods, usually sent thence for England, might and probably would
(though in dull markets) when the shipp had here arived have produced sixtie
per cent profitt, which would have amounted to about seaventie
thousand Rialls of eight, Soe that the companies losse (occasioned betweene Bantam and Surat
by the said dutch their not suffereing the said shipp to goe into Bantam)
being fifteene thousand Rialls of eight at five shillings per Riall
(which is the usuall valew) amounts to three thousand seaven hundred and fiftie
pounds sterling, and their losse betweene Surat and England (occasioned

Thomas Bowdler of Shadwell in the County of Middlesex
Marchant, aged 35 yeeres or thereabouts sworne and
examined.

To the second article of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth
that in the yeare 1656 the Governour and Company of the
English East India Company had in their merchandizing
affaires and imployment in the parts of East India a certaine
shipp named the Endimion whereof Gervase Couchman
was Commander from which shipp or the Captaine or company
thereof or any of them there was not any the least offered
or iniury offered to the dutch shipps that were in those parts
or to any of them, or their Captaines or company, or any of them
which hee knoweth for that hee was Purser of her and went
the voyage in her from place to place.

To the third article hee saith that the premisses not withstanding
the said shipp the Endimion in her voyage from England for
Bantam comming in the moneth of August of the said yeere 1656
into the Streight of Sunda, met with a single shipp appertaining
to the dutch, which sailed along with the Endimion till shee came
neere Pulla[?p]anjam, where fowre dutch vessells more were riding
which seeing her, alsoe weighed and comming neare her, told her
Captaine that hee must speake with their Admirall, who hee saitth
was rideing to the Eastward of Pullapanjam amongest his
fleete of eight saile more of shipps and many small sloopes
and pro[XX]s, which hee did, and came to an anchor neere the Admirall
and the next day the Admirall commanded her to anchor nearer to
his shipp, which was alsoe obeyed, all which hee knoweth being present and
hearing and seeing the premisses soe donne and commanded.

To the fourth article hee saith and deposeth that the said Captain
Couchman being indisposed, willed this deponent Purser of the said shipp
to goe aboard the Admirall and knowe the reason of such commanding [?her]
to and keeping them at an anchor, and this deponent accordingly goeing
aboard, the said Admirall or Commander named dierick Scoutten,
plainely told this deponent (after this deponents acquainting him with their
designe of merchandizing imployment for the English east India Company, and that [?XXX]
they were then bound and intended to goe into Bantam) that they should
not goe into Bantam Roade, whereupon this deponent desired leave to [?XXXX]
in their boate with a letter of advice of their arivall to the said English Compan[yes]
agent there, offering that the same boate should in [?such] going come
aboard him to be visited, but hee denied that alsoe, and told this deponent
that they should neither goe in with their shipp nor send in their boate
pretending
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.497r Annotate
pretending for their deniall, that hee had order not to suffer any shipps or boates
to goe in or out for that (as hee said) the dutch had  warr with the king of
Bantam.

To the fifth article hee saith that the said Commander or Admirall and company
kept the said shipp the Endimion under that restraint and in that condition for the
space of nine dayes, in which space although this deponent and Captaine Couchmann
going severall times aboard, and expostulating about such their detention, and
insisting for libertie to goe into Bantam, the said Admirall still persisted in
his deniall and told them still that they should not goe in, for hee had order to the contrary,
and because they were earnest for leave to goe in, one dutch Captaine that was
present told them that if they (meaning the Captaine and companie of the Endimion)
were stronger than they (speaking of the dutch that were there) they should or
might goe in, otherwise they should not, Whereupon after the said space
of nine dayes restraint, the said Captaine and companie of the Endimion
being soe kept out of Bantam and seeing noe hopes of getting in went
with their said shipp for Jambee, Where heaving procured what pepper
they could, they set saile back againe for Bantam, [XXXX] where unto they arived about
three monethes after such their first departure thence which was on the
eighteenth of August 1656, hoping then that they should not meete with any
obstacle, but might goe freely into Bantam roade, there to compleate their
tonnage, and soe to saile for England. But there they found severall saile
of dutch shipps riding, two of which upon sight of the Endimion weighed
where shee was found to come againe for an anchor, and then this deponent
went aboard the commander of them in cheife named Commander John
Petersson Lelly in the Erasmus, to know wherefore they were yet againe
commanded to an anchor, and stopt, and whether they might yet goe into
Bantam, and be[XXXXX] him that they might goe in, telling him what prejudice
the East India Company of England had alreadie and were like further
to suffer by such their prohibition, whereupon with much adoe and as
if hee had donne the English a greate favour, hee permitted them to send
in their boate to give notice  to the English agent of their being there, but
would by noe meanes permit the shipp to goe in, nor suffer the boate to
carry or bring ought but advise, to which purpose they searched her going
and comming.

To the sixth hee saith that having received the sayd advise, the English Agent came
aboard the said Commander of the dutch fleete in cheif, and in this
deponents presence and hearing (who went aboard with him) [?besought]
and was very earnest with the said Commander or Admirall for leave
for the said shipp to come into banta, roade to receive such goods as were
there in readinesse for her, but his answer was that hee durst not give
leave without expresse order from Batavia, Whereupon the said agent
and Counsell sent letters to Battavia to the Generall of the dutch
to get order thence for her going in, But (as this deponent heard the Agent
say the said Generall and Counsell at Battavia sent answer that
they would not permit any shipp or shipps whatsoever to goe in, or
any going to and fro betwixt the shipps and shoare in any manner
Whatsoever, or to the same effect.

To the seaventh hee saith that having received the said answer, the said
English Agent (being Agent Skinner) came aboard the Endimion
and [XXXXX]d the Captaine and companie to weigh and saile for
Battavia, for that hee would see what hee could doe
(as hee said) in person about getting leave for the said shipp to goe in,
and comming there, hee went severall times to the Castle
to make addresses to the Generall for leave, but at length retourned
aboard and declared that hee had laboured in vaine and that notwithstanding
all his arguments and importunitie for leave, the Generall had

meanes of which stopping of her and deniall by the dutch of her going in to
take in such goods as were there provided for her, shee was forced to
retourne for England with considerable quantitie of dead freight, to the
greate dammage of the said English company (besides the dishonour
redounding by the predeposed to the English nation) being forced to have their goods left behinde,
which were probable to lie there and perish or be lost, and greate dis[?XXXX]

this deponent espied two shipps which after wards made saile towards her
and they having espied a white Ensigne upon one of them
and having before heard some report that there were ffrench
men of warr come into the parts of India, [gave]
them cause to suspect them to be such, but comming neare to
her, they perceived them to have the Holland colours aboard
and saith that at a distance they shott from the Headmost of
the said two shipps, three guns, two thereof thwart her fore[?XXX]
and the other over her, and although the said shipp Benjamin
did slack her sailes asmuch as conveniently shee (in this deponents
iudgement) could, yet the said head most shipp comming very neere
powred a broad side, or the greatest part of a
broadside into her and shott severall small shotts, and
that by such shooting and powring in the said greate guns, hee
saith there were seaven or eight of the Baniamins men
wounded, and her hull passed through with
six or seaven shott, whereby the same with her tackle and

told that the commander of the said shipp that soe shott at the
Baniamin (and aboard which they were as aforesaid carried) was
named de[?r]ick Swart, and his said shipp the Mars and was a
dutch shipp belonging to the Netherland East India Company
and that the name of the said other shipp (which was alsoe come
up) was the [X]ierick Sea, and was alsoe a dutch shipp
belonging to the said Company of the Netherlands,
and this to his best remembrance happened in the moneth of
November 1656, the day hee doth not remember. And saith
that being soe aboard the said derrick Sw[?e?e]rt; and some words
passing betwixt them about that hostile action, the said
Swart in passion declared and said (as this deponent understood
his broken speech betweene dutch and English) that had his grapnell
?held, hee would (as this deponent remembreth his words)
have cut their throats, speaking of the Benaimins company.
And saith that this deponent requested him to let him goe aboard

could not give leave till the Admirall came, and when the
Admirall came this deponent made the same request to him to the
same purpose, but hee denied, and would not suffer this deponent
to goe or [?send] in, and therefore after five dayes space that
the Baniamin had bin under the said restraint or seizure, shee was
faine to depart for Surat, without speaking with the

had the English colours ab[?r]oad, plaine to be seene. And further
hee deposeth not, saving the said two dutch shipps were men of warr.

To the nineteenth hee saith hee conceiveth the owners of the said
shipp by the said shooting and tearing the hull and rigging of the Baniamin
have suffered dammage to the summe of one hundred pounds sterling,
and the Imployers to have suffered very greate dammage by the
premisses, in having their voyage disappointed, the retourne of the
said shipp delayed their market lost, their goods lost by hinder

To the first article of the sayd allegation hee saith he cannot depose
for that hee went not in the shipp Catherine the voyage in question nor [?sawe]
the oyles arlate laden aboard the sayd shipp , saving hee saith hee this deponent
being imployed by the sayd david Bonnell to receave the
the sayd oyles after they were brought to London did
thereby observe that the Caske wherein the sayd oyles in
question were were very ill and loose stowed betwixt decks but were good
caske saving for such dammage as by their ill stowage not being
well coyned they had receaved, whereby theyre hoopes were
loosned and the caske had given way by being wowled and tumbled out
against an other with the workeing of the sea for want of good
standing Coynes and under Coynes and bedds And further
saving his subsequent deposition hee cannot depose/

To the 2 article hee saith that of this deponents sight and knowledge
at the tyme of the delivery of the butts of oyle in question in

wholly runne out and some others of them much leaked out
in soe much that of the nyneteene tonnes of oyle and three quarters
which the sayd butts ought to have conteyned there was want[ing]
sixe tonnes of oyle and a halfe this hee knoweth for that hee
and his contest John Collyns were present and sawe the Gager for this Cittie of London
take the gage of them who upon gageing of them found them
to want soe much oyle which sixe tonnes
and a halfe of oyle soe wanting and leaked out would in this
deponents Judgment have yeilded heere in London the summe of
three hundred pounds stereling and better it being of the better
sorte of Eating Oyle of Genoa, which is of this
deponents knowledge usually sold in oyle shopps in London at
the rate of forty five pounds per tonne at the least and some tymes at
fifty five pounds a tonne/

with the Masters Mate and the Boatswaine and Cooper of the sayd
shipp Katherine and asked them in what condition they thought the
sayd Bonells peeces of oyle which they had aboard were, in, whereto
every of them replyed thus or the like in effect that they feared that
there was great losse  in them by leakage for they had leaked ever
since the sayd shipp came out of the Streights mouth which was
as they sayd about thirty dayes before this deponent came soe to
enquire about them, whereupon this deponent asked them why they
did not save the oyle that they had pumped out ever since they came
from the streights mouth whereto they answered that there was
a difference betweene the Master of the Catherine and his Company
and that they did not owe the Master soe much service as to save
the same, for they did not know whether they should get any
wages of him or not for the sayd voyage, whereto this deponent
answered and told them it was a usuall thing to save pumpe oyle
and that they had done ill not to save [it] and that hee feared
they would suffer dammage by it whereto they answered that
they did not much valew it, for the Company was in a desperate
Condition concerneing their wages and had bin at difference
with the Master most part of the voyage And further to this article

of the sayd Mr Bonnell aboard his shipp for about fowerteene dayes
after this deponent soe came to enquire after them, before the same
were delivered from aboard the sayd shipp, which occasioned a great
part of the leakeage which happened to the sayd oyles, and was alsoe
of this deponents knowledge a great hindrance to the sayd Bonnell
in the price of the sayd oyles for that in those fowerteene
dayes tyme the price of oyle was of this deponents knowl;edge

[?XXX] into Bantam in the East Indias there to take in her Lading)
Smith:/:)

Examined upon an allegation
given in on the behalf of
the said Abraham hill and others

Rp. 1

William Stannard of Rederiff in the County of
Surrey Mariner, aged 32 yeares or thereabouts
sworne and examined.

To the first article of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth
that hee well knew the ship the Olive Branch arlate the time
arlate, and saith hee also well knoweth Abraham hill, John Gregory,
and henery Crane, and that they and Company were the time arlate
commonly accounted the true and Lawfull owners of the said
vessel and of her tackle apparell and furniture, And further
hee cannot depose

To the second article hee saith that the said ship within the said
time was sett out from this port and imployed in a voyage for
Bantam, in the parts of East India there to take in her lading
and bring the same for Ligorne, on which voyage shee proceeded
from Gravesend on or about the 24th of May 1656, and that
shee arrived in the said parts of East India neere Bantam on
or about the three and twentieth day (old stile) of December then
next following, at which time her master and company were
fully determined to goe and carry her and her lading into Bantam
and take in such goods as were there to be laded aboard her, all
which hee knoweth being one of her company, namely her cheife
mate when shee soe arrived.

To the third article hee saith that the said three and twentieth
(or thereabouts) of December 1656 as the said ship was sailing and
going in for Bantam, two dutch shipps that lay at anchor espying
her, weighed and stood with her, and at length fetcht her up
and shott two guns with bullets, the one a head and the
other asterne her, and saith there were at the same time three
other dutch shipps lying further off but in the way that the
Olive Branch was to passe to goe into Bantam, and saith that
the said five dutch shipps were belonging (as was there commonly
said and reported) to the East India Company of Holland or of
the United Netherlands.

To the fourth article hee saith that after and upon such shooting
and coming up of the said dutch shipps, the Captaine of one
of them came aboard the Olive Branch and demanded of
her master whence hee came and whether hee was bound with
his said ship,  to which the said master (John Brampton by name)
made answer that hee came with his said ship and company from
London and was bound into Bantam, to take in his said ships  lading
whereupon
~~~
HCA 13/72 f.517v Annotate
whereupon the said dutch Captaine replied and said that the
said ship the Olive branch might not go into Bantam, for they
(speaking of his and the said other dutch shipps and Captaines)
lay there purposely to hinder and obstruct all English shipps
from going into or trading at Bantam, or with the Inhabitants
thereof, or there passed words betwixt them to the same effect
and the said dutch Captaine then and there  commanded the said
master of the Olive branch to beare up and come to or by his
admiral, which hee saith was accordingly donne, the premises
hee deposeth of his owne sight and hearing, being as aforesaid
masters mate of the said vessel the Olive branch, And further to
this article hee deposeth not.

To the fifth hee saith that the said ship the Olive branch
being soe brought and coming to an anchor neere the said Admirall
of the said dutch shipps, the said John Brampton her master went
aboard the said Admirall with purpose (as hee declared) to get leave
of him to geo into Bantam and take in his lading, and carried
a present, to bestow on him for
better to induce him to give leave for the said shipps going in, bu
upon his retourne hee declared that the said Admirall would by
noe meanes give leave, but expressely forbad her going in
although hee had acquainted him with her coming from London
and her being bound to goe in to receive her lading there. And
further hee cannot depose.

To the sixth article hee saith thatupon the said prohibition
of the said dutch Admirall, the said Captaine Brampton and
company set saile with the Olive branch for Battavia the
place of the dutch Generalls residence, purposing to acquaint
mr Frederick Skinner the English agent, (who was gone
thither before) with their being soe stopt from going to Bantam
and to use his mediation with the Generall for their going?s in, but
upon the said shipps arrival at Battavia, they met the said mr Skinner
coming from the said Generall, who (after the said Brampton had
acquainted him with the cause of his coming thither as aforesaid) told
him that hee came then from the Generall, with whom hee had bin
to get permission for the ship the Endimion which wanted only some
small quantities of her lading to goe into Bantam for the same,  but
that the said Generall would not give leave, but had expressely forbidden
the going in either of the Endimion or any other English shipps whatsoever
whereupon they set saile againe for the roade of Bantam,
intending to trie againe if they could get in, but the said
dutch shipps there lying espying her, [?XXXX]ed and ?towed
their shipps neere her and anchored round about her, and
told her master flatly that shee should not goe in, and
that if hee made any more endeavour to get in, they would
??smite his ship or to that effect, and and soe shee was utterly
disappointed and hindered from goin in, all which hee knoweth for
the reasons aforesaid. and further deposeth not.

To

HCA 13/72 f.518r Annotate
To the seaventh hee saith that the said master and company being by the dutch soe
frustrated of all her hopes of carrying the Olive branch into Bantam
they went with her to a small Iland on the coast of
Sumatra called Pullay[?mudi], being an extreame hot and unhealthy
place where the master and diverse others of the said ships company
died, and there the said ship remained about eleaven weekes
and tooke in such lading as shee could have privately brought from
Bantam in boates by night, which hee knoweth, being
then become master of her upon such the said Bramptons death. And
further hee deposeth not.

To the eighth hee saith that be meanes of the said ship the Olive
branch her soe long tarrying there for her lading (occasioned by the
dutch as aforesaid) shee lost her Montsoones (sic), (being
a constant winde serving for such a space of time to bring shipps
thense for theise parts, and constantly for another space (after
that is over) blowing the contrary way) and by meanes thereof
was forced to put into the Mauritius to winter, the time being
past for her coming for England, which hee knoweth being then
master of her.

To the nineth hee saith that the said ship did not come to ligorne
(although shee used all diligence) until the seaventeenth
(old stile) of January 1657, or thereabouts, whereas if
shee had bin permitted in time to have gone into Bantam,
shee might have dispatch taking in her lading there in a
matter of fourteen or sixteen dayes (and soe agent Skinner
assured them they might) and that in all probabilitie shee
might and would have arrived at Ligorne in the moneth of July
1657 namely six monethes or thereabouts sooner than shee did/
all which delay and the damage thereof came and was occasioned
by such detention and hinderance by the said dutch ships, which dutch
ships were in the service and imployment of the
East India company of the United Netherlands, and soe
commonly accounted.

To the tenth hee saith the said ship the Olive branch was and
is of the burthen of two hundred tonnes or thereabouts, and
carried in her the said voyage eighteen guns and fourtie two
men and boyes, and was worth [XXXX] to freight  for the
East Indias two hundred and fiftie pounds per moneth or
thereabouts, which hee knoweth being a mariner of many
yeares standing, and having bin master of her.

To the eleaventh hee saith that this deponent (then master) and
company of the said ship using all diligence to further and
advantage their voyage, after the winter was a little over speeded
away from the Mauritius, and by reason of such their early
coming away, met with extreame and violent stormes,

by the meanes whereof shee was in danger of perishing with
her company, and was hurt and [?en]damaged
in her maste sailes, rigging and hull, to the valew of two hundred
pounds sterling or thereabouts, which had undoubtedly bin
avoided in case the said dutch had not soe stayed and hindered
her as aforesaid. yielding a reason as aforesaid.

To the twelveth hee saith that the said Abraham hill, John
Gregory, henry Crane and company by reason of the said
wrongs and hinderances soe donne them by the said dutch
shipps and companies, have in losse of time as aforesaid
deterioration of the said ship in her masts, sailes, rigging
and hull as aforesaid, and otherwise suffered losse and
damage to the summe of two thousand pounds sterling or
thereabouts in his estimation. And hee cannot
further depose.

To the 13th hee saith that Bantam afoeresaid is a place
to and at which the English have traded for many yeeres
namely (as hee hath bin credibly informed) for fourtie or fiftie
yeares last, and have not bin hindered that ever hee had heard till
about May 1656 that the dutch interrupted such their
freedom of trading there, and saith that by common repute
there hath bin an English factorie and severall English merchants
and factors there resident for all the time aforesaid. And
this hee saith is publique and notorious.

To the 14th article and the schedule annexed hee saith and
deposeth that hee this deponent was presenton the
day of the date of the said schedule namely the 21th of March
1656(57) aboard the said ship at Pulla[?gund] aforesaid, when
and where hee saw the arlate ffrederick Skinner, James
Bostock and Robert Cock subscribe the same with their respective
hands, and that the said Skinner was then Agent for the
English East India Company at Bantam, and the said
Bostock and Cock were English merchants there resident,

the way the Olive Branch was to passe in her goeing into Bantam, And
saith the whole five shipps aforesaid (as was there commonly sayd) did
belong to the sayd dutch East India Company./

To the 4th article hee saith that upon such shooteing one of the Captaines
of the sayd dutch shipps came presently aboard the Olive Branch and asked
the Master whence shee came, and whether shee was bound, whereto
the Master (John Brampton) replyed that shee came from London, and was bound
for Bantam there to take in her ladeing, whereto the Captaine of the sayd
dutch ship answered thus or the like in effecte wee lye here on
purpose to hinder all English shipps from having Commerce with those
of Bantam, and told the sayd Brompton hee must not nor should goe
in with his sayd ship and commanded him to beare up and come
to the Admirall of the sayd dutch ffleete, which the sayd Brampton did
accordingly And further hee cannot depose/

To the 5th hee saith the Olive Branch being come up to the Admirall of
the dutche ffleete the sayd Brampton the Master of her went aboard the
Admirall  with purpose (as after his Coming back aboard the Olive
Branch hee declared in presence of this deponent and others) to get leave
of the sayd Admirall to goe into Bantam and take in his ladeing,
but could not get leave, whereupon
the sayd Brampton came aboard the Olive Branch againe and fetched a
present and carried it aboard the dutch Admirall to bestowe on him the
better (as hee beleeveth) to induce him to give leave for the Olive Branch to
goe into Bantam which notwithstanding (as the sayd Brampton
upon his returne aboard the Olive Branch declared before this deponent
and others) the sayd Admirall expressely denyed to give the sayd Brampton
leave to goe into Bantam though hee told him hee came from London and
was bound thither to take in his ladeing, but forbid him to goe in thither

Agent who was gone thither before and to whom the Olive Branch was consigned at Bantam to receave of him her ladeing there  with his the sayd Bramptons being
soe hindered from goeing into Bantam, and to desire his assistance
to the Generall to procure leave for her to goe in, And saith that upon the
arrival of the Olive Branch at Batavia the sayd Brampton there met

of the dutch there, and procure leave of him for the Olive Branch to goe
into Bantam, and the sayd Mr Skinner (as the sayd Brampton aff[irmed]
to this deponent and others of the Company of the Olive Branch) told the sayd
Brampton that it was to noe purpose to sollicite the Generall to that
effect, for hee the sayd Skinner had bin there with the Generall to get
permission for the ship Endymion (who wanted only some smal[e]
quantitie of her ladeing) to goe into Bantam for the same, and that
the Generall had utterly refused to give any such leave, and had
expressely forbidden the goeing thither of the Endymion or any
other English ship whatsoever, Whereupon this deponent well knoweth
that the sayd Brampton sett sayle with the Olive Branch from
Battavia in Company of the Endymion for the roade of Bantam
intending to trye againe if they could get in, but the dutch
shipps there lyeing espying them, weighed Anchor and towed
their shipps with their boates (there being little wynde) and came
and Anchored round about the Olive Branch and Endymion, and told
the Masters of them in expresse termes that they should not goe
in to Bantam, this hee deposeth of his sight and knowledge, And
hath heard divers of the Company of the Olive branch saye
that they heard the Commanders and Companyes of the sayd
dutch shipps saye and threaten that if the Endymion and Olive
Branch did endeavour any more to goe in to Bantam they
would sinke them, by which meanes the Olive Branch and
Endymion were both (of this deponents knowledge) hindered from
goeing into Bantam to take in their ladeing there, And further
hee cannot depose./

To the 7th hee saith that the Master and Company of the Olive Branch
being by the dutch hindered from goeing with their sayd ship into
Bantam they went with her to a smale Island called Pullagunde
being upon the Coast of Sumatra, and being an extreame hot
and unhealthfull place, where by reason of the Intemperature
thereof the Master of her the sayd Brampton, and divers of his
Company dyed, And the sayd ship was constrained to stay there
eleaven weekes and better to take in her ladeing which was
secretly brought thither from Bantam in boates in the
night tyme, this hee knoweth being then Mate to William
Stannard, who upon the death of the sayd Brampton (being before
chief Mate) became Master of her And further hee cannot depose

meanes aforesaid soe long in ladeing shee lost her Monsoones,
which is a constant winde which continually (until a certayne tyme
in the yeare) blowes to bring shipps thence for England, and
after such a tyme blowes contrary, soe that thereby the Olive
Branch was forced to put into a place called the Maurisses

there taken in the same in about fourteen or sixteen dayes
tyme shee being but a smale ship and her ladeing (as the foresaid
Skinner affirmed) being all in a readinesse, And then in all proba
bility, shee might have arrived therewith at Ligorne sixe or seaven

whereby the sayd ship was in very great hazard and danger,
and susteyned much damage both in her hull, sayles,
