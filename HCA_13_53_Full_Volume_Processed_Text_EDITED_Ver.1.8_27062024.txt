her best bower Cable breake beinge about ten or eleaven ynches
and the anchor therunto belonginge was loste which Cable when it was newe (as he

eighte hundred weight or therabouts when it was first bought

then rode brake likewise neere unto the sayd anchor (as he gueseth) and that
part of the sayd Cable which was lefte, they were inforced by extremity
of the sayd storme for the preservacon of the sayd shipp and goods, to cutt off
close by the windles because the shipp would not beare up against the sea before it was cutt and then it run out all into the sea, and was lost,

cutt off and lost of that Cable neere about fowerscore and ten fathom, and the
sayd Cable did likewise cost as much as the other did videlicet thirtye
six shillings per Centum therabouts (as hee beleiveth, and was aboute a
quarter worne or little more and the anchor lost togeither with that Cable (beinge
her sheat anchor) weighed ten hundred weight or therabouts (as he guesseth)
and was little worse then it was when it was newe, and cost thirtye shillings
per hundred (as he beleiveth) Alsoe there was lost which the sayd Cables
and anchor) two buoyes and buoy ropes each of them beinge about sixteene
fathom longe and about six ynches about, which buoy ropes were little the worse for
