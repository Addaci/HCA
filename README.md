English High Court of Admiralty deposition volumes [HCA 13/20 to HCA 13/79, covering the years 1570 to 1685]
These transcriptions are the work product of the MarineLives project, a volunteer led collaboration launched in 2012 and going strong twelve years later
We aim to have a high quality machine transcription of all volumes covering the period 1570 to 1685 complete by end 2025
All transcriptions will be made available to the public on an open source basis
That's roughly 30 million words. We have 5 million words completed to date.

To complete this task we need two things (1) The help of volunteers (2) Roughly £20,000 of funding for Transkribus computer time
If you would like to help us in this challenge, please go to our GoFundMe site and make a small contribution. 
We have over 3,000 followers on Twitter [https://x.com/Marinelivesorg}. If each follower made a £5 or £10 contribution we could achieve our target.
