Cuckold Point arlate before such tyme as shee came
ashore at Dickshore where hee saith shee was and
remained soe aground by the space of about one hower
whereby hee saith hee is confident the said shippe the
Saint Jacob did receave much damage and hurt
reddens rationem scientia se ut supra. Et alr nescit deponere
saveing that hee saith that the said ship did as hee
conceaveth soe runne ashore as aforesaid by the reason
that shee had neither a Pilot nor any other abord her
that did knowe or was acquainted with the River of Thames
or how to conduct a laden ship up the said River as they ought

there by the space of Allmost two Moneths nmext before
the said tyme as an Emptie shipp (as indeed shee then was)
haveing finished her voyage And saith that the palce
wherein the said shipp was soe laied up was such and
soe out of the way that in all probabilitie shee could neither

they would willfully runne upon her as the shippe

her head a fdrye ground at Lowe water and her stearne
sitting upon the chaine to which ships rideing in the said
River of Thames are usually fastned by reason whereof
the said shippe being a deepe laden shippe was much [?XXX]
and strained and her seames thereby much opened which
hee is confidently assured that what damage
soever did happen into the said shipp the Saint Jacob
which faine was done and did soe come by her said
Running aground both at Dickshore and before that at
Cuckolds point arlate And not by any Anchor or [?XXXX]

another violent storme which raged soe high and was soe boysterous that
for the preservation of the said ship and her ladeing together with the lives of

a vessell arived at Caraccas, from Santo domingo, which came from
Santo domingo in her company, and had lost her at sea in fowle weather
with much other newes of the like nature tending to inveigle him ashore) went

more negro's or goods to be landed, untill hee had received aboard some
retournes for what were already sent ashore, telling him that
if hee delivered and put ashore the remainder, and tooke nothing
aboard in truck for the same, there would be nothing left to pay
them their wages, acquainting hin withall, with what they heard
and iustly suspected touching the Spaniards said designe upon him,
them and the said shipp and lading, or to that effect, whereat
the said Captaine Jacket being much enraged, tould them in
greate passion, that hee would spend five thousand pounds
rather than they should have a penny wages, and that hee
would make their bellies cleare to their backs, in case they went
about to hinder him in what hee did and intended or to the
