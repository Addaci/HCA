George Cheatham of Greenwich in the County of Kent Trumpeter
aged 20 years or thereabouts swore and examined sayeth as followeth videlicet

To the first interrogatory he ayeth that he this examinate was in
the interrogate shippe the William and was Trumperters mate thereof
at such tyme as she went from Tunis towards Leghorne the last
voyage interrogate And the said shippe sayled a longe quietly and
peaceably the said voyage till suche tyme as she mett with 2 men of
warr which afterwards proved to be ffrench men./

To the second he sayeth That in the Course of the shippe the William
from Tunis towards Leghorne she mett with the 2 shipps of warr
articulate, which twoe shippes lay under the shoare and at anchor (as this examinate
beleiveth) And that at the tyme when the Company of the said shippe
the William descryed the twoe shipps of warr aforesaid: they had
the Colours of Saint George for England in the Mayntopp and
thei Ensigne in the Poope whereby the said 2 shipps of warr might
easely perceive the said William and her Company to be Englishe./

To the third he sayeth That so soone as the said two shipps of warr
had weighed anchor they made directly towards the shipp the William
withall theyre sayles spredd (except their spritt sayle) and there Spritt
Sayleyard alonge shipps and a grapnell out uppon the boltspritt and ready
to Clapp the William on board; And this Examinate sayeth that the said 2
shipps of warr all had not any Colours out that were discerneable
whereby to distinguish what they were by reason whereof the Campany
of the said shippe the William took them to be Turcks./

To the fourth he sayeth That the Master and Company of the interrogate
the William (when they saw the said twoe shipps of warr come to
windward of them) did discharge and shoot off twoe paire of
Ordonanse at their fforefoote, to Cause them not to come to the windward but
to fall a sterne and Come to the Leeward; And that the said two shott
did misse the said twoe shipps of warr and were not intended to hitt them
or either of them./

shott off from the shipp the William as aforesaid the said twoe

stile kept to the windward of her and bore up with her and sent out
not a boate within calle whoe badd the Company  of the William
lower their flagg and amayne for the Kinge of ffrannse which the
Master of the William then refused to doe./

To the sixt he sayeth That the place where the shipp the
William was mett withall is very dangerous bt reason of the
great resort thither of Turcks men of warr; And it is an ordinary
thing with the Turcks to make use of the Colours of any
Country to serve their present occasions and deceive those with
whome they meet, and to bidd amayne in the  name of any Prince
or State whatsoever untill they come on board their prize./

To the 7th he sayeth That this Examinate and the rest of the
Company of the shipp the William (when they sawe the
shiooe of warr come to windward of them) did berely perswade
themselves that they were Turcks men of warr and not ffrenchmen
And this Examinate for his part vereley beleeveth That inc ase the Master and
Company of ye William had certainly knowne That the said twoe shipps of warr
had belonged to the ffrench Kinge he had Caused his flagg to be
stricken; And afterwards knoweing them to be so did strike his
flagg which notwithstanding the said 2 ffrenchmen still continued
shooting untill they had given the master his mortall wounde whereof
he dyed within 4 or 5 houres after, and killed 4 men more and
hurt twoe./
