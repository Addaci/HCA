the ffriendshipp arlate and went to Mallega in her where shee safely
arived and came to an anchor about three miles from the [?towne] out
of command of the Artillery, and that in the moneth
of October last (the day hee doth not precisely remember) Barnaby
Holding the master of the said shipp sent her boate ashoare about six
of the clock in the morning well manned according to the order of the
arlate Mr Whetby who as factor for the said shipps lading there; and
the said boate in conformitie to his Mr Whitbies command attended upon him in expectation
to have had a raft of wine to be carried aboard the said shipp the said
forenoone, the weather being then good and the sea calme, soe as the
said Mr Whitby sent off wine the same forenoone to other shipps,
all which hee knoweth being one of the said shipps company and
going in the said boate and seeing the premisses soe donne. And otherwise
hee cannot depose.

To the sixth hee saith the said Mr Whitby did neglect to send, (at least
did not send) any wine to the said shipp the friendshipp all that forenoone
and while the weather was good and callme, but about three of the
clock in the afternoone of the same day, hee commanded thee men to
(whereof this deponent was one) to cast off his butts of wine to be
carried aboard the ffriendshipp, but the Levant breeze comming then in
and the sea running very high, the said master seeing the same, sent out his
skiff with six oares, to command the men that were attending with
their boate to come on board and not to meddle with any wines, in
regard of the danger, the sea comming in soe fast and high; howbeit
hee saith the said whitby commnaded them to stay and to proceede
in rafting off the wines, which when some of the company denied, the
said whitby said hee had much wines upon the Play, and they
must raft it off that night; whereupon at his command they went
on to raft off thirtie peeces, and endeavoured to towe them aboard to
give him content, but the sea comming in very violently, the ropes
were torne in peeces, and alsoe the emptie buts that were to buoy up
the said raft of wines, and the said raft and emptie butts were twice
broken loose before by the said violence of the sea, before the
company could bring the raft within a mile of the shipp, and that
after much tugging and rowing, it was about tenn of the clock
at night before the said company could get aboard, albeit that
there came severall boates to their aide and assistance. And saith the
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.5v Annotate
said shipp then heaved and sent above five foot high, soe as her boate
was not able to lie by her side, and by meanes of the said fowle
weather and violense of the sea, after all the care, labour and
industrie of the company (which hee saith they improved to the utmost)
hee the said ropes breaking the said wines sunck and were lost
all saving one butt, for the recovery of which wines soe sunck
hee saith the company used all diligence with creeping, grapnells
and sweeping with roapes, but could not recover any of them.
The premisses hee deposeth of his owne sight and knowledge. And
cannot otherwise depose.

To the seaventh hee saith the said Robert Whitby himselfe bought the
ropes wherewith the said wines were strung and rafted of this deponents
sight and knowledge, this deponent waiting on him therein, and carrying
the said ropes (after mr whitby had bought them) to the water side: and
saith the sad ropes were broken with the extraordinary roughnesse
and violense of the sea, and saith the said wines were lost by being
carried in such rough and tempestuous weather (which was donne in
obediense to mr whitbys command) and not by any default or
neglect of or in the shipps company, who hee saith used their utmost
diligence and endeavour for the preservation thereof.

To the eighth hee saith that the sea comming in soe fast and
running soe high the said afternoone, it was noe way fit to goe
off with any wines, insoemuch that other merchants who had laded
wines in the morning and had more to lade aboard other shipps,
(as the Olive branch arlate and others) commanded the boates to goe
and retourne that afternoone aboard their severall shipps without
carrying any wines, in regard of the impetuousnesse of the seas and
and danger of carrying any aboard. All which hee knoweth being

voyage, namely on the thirteenth day of March last past old stile shee arrived

To the second Article of the sayd allegation he saith that over and besides
the sayd 100 baggs of wooll, there were laden on board the sayd shipp
during her stay att Cyprus after her last coming thither, two hundred and eight
baggs of wooll by Roger ffooke factor of the sayd Mr Alderman

her. And saith that in his Judgement. forty four men in a shipp of
the burthen of the Thomas Bonadventure (there being 100 baggs of
wooll and 400 and odd baggs of galls on board before,) cannot receive
and steive above eight baggs a day one day with another, for hee saith
that the Company of the sayd Thomas Bonadventure the sayd tyme
att Cyprus did not receyve on board and steive above eight baggs of wooll
eaćh day and day with another during such tyme as the sayd ffrederickes Chownes
and the other thirty sackes of wooll were lading, albeit they did worke
twenty howres of in four and twenty, and that with much labour and Industry

more than eight baggs a day one day with another as he beleiveth, referring

their steeving Instruments on shoare, and applyed themselves to
fitt their shipp for her homewards voyage for London, and shee
might have bene so fitted within two or three dayes, And her master

To the third he saith that the Thomas Bonadventure lay about a league from the shore

receyved them on board in the space of 4. 5. 6. or 10 dayes in case they were
not to be steeved on that or those day or dayes in which they were to be received

To the 4th hee saith that the sayd steeving Instruments were of his knowledge
twice carryed on shoare after the sayd shipps returne from Scanderoone to
Ciprus, and were not brought away in the sayd shipp.  And otherwise hee
cannot depose.

To the 5th he saith he never was att Ciprus saving the voyage in question.

To the 6th he saith the direct way to sayle from Salina Road in Cyprus to England
is to sayle in a direct Course to the Streights mouth. And he beleiveth
that Zant is about 15 leagues out of the way, And farther saving his
foregoeing depositions to which he referreth he cannot depose.

To the 7th hee saith that wind and weather serving the direct course from
Zant to England is directly to the Streights mouth. and he beleiveth that
Corsica is about 40 or 50 leagues out of the way.  howbeit he saith that in
those seas such winds usually happen that the Course from Zant to Corsica
and so to the Streights mouth may assoone be performed as the foresayd direct
Course. And otherwise hee cánnot depose.

To the 8th he saith that to sayle from Zant to the Streights mouth, Leghorne

To the 9th he saith that when 100 baggs of Cotton woolls are steeved in a ship
of two hundred and eighty tonnes, there cánnot be one hundred and
seventy baggs more of Cotton wools or any greater number recyved on board the sayd shipp
and steeved afterwards: but the same may be receyved on board by a
few att a tyme as the labour of steeving can be expedited. And saith that
forty four men cannot in the space of 6. 8 or 10 dayes receyve the sayd
number of baggs on board and steeve them afterwards, becáuse the
bulke and number of so many baggs would make them unexpeable to worke,
but the same may and ought to be recyved on board by a few att atyme as
the steeving goes forwards, and further saving his precedent depositions
to which he referreth he cannot depose.

To the .10th. Interrogatorie. he saith he well remembreth that Captain Hughes after
he had bene advised to stay for the Convoy by the sayd Roger ffooke and
Chowne did submitt to such advise and sayd he would stay for the  Convoy.
and this he sayd on board his shipp in this deponents presence, and the

To the 11th. he saith that the galls interrate were not shott loose in the bottome of
the sayd shipp to serve in stead of ballast. but were putt up in sackes
and he is sure that they were brought in the sayd shipp to Porto Longone
in sackes. And othewise he cannot depose.

To the 12th. he saith that when Cotton wools are in steeving on board a shipp
It is the usuall way first to lay a Tier of baggs, and then to steeve in
as many more att the least, and for the most part more than are tiered
And the same Course was observed by the Company of the Thomas Bonad=
venture in lading the woolls aforesayd: And further he cannot

To the 13th he saith that when wools are steeving, It is usuall to fetch
about 20 baggs on board att a tyme. and so from tyme to tyme to fetch

constantly in steeving that noe tyme be lost, and be also free from the
camber and trouble of so many baggs as might hinder them in their

To the 14th hee saith that to the best of his remembrance there could not above six
or seven baggs be layd in one tiere in the sayd shipp. And hee saith that
so many (after the instruments are placed ) may in a short tyme visit in all
houres or hee be tiered by forty four men; but as for the steeving it is
more difficult and requires much tyme in so much as some dayes not above
three baggs were or could be steeved and some tymes but one on a day
notwith standing all diligence was upon and some tymes what was done
was of necessity to be unsteeved againe . howbeit he saith some dayes ten
or twelve baggs were steeved, so as this deponents judgement about
eight baggs a day one day with another may be tiered and steeved
by the number of men interate in a shipp of the burthen aforesayd
And further saving as aforesayd he cannot depose.

To the 15th Interrogatories he saith that on the 23rd day of may interrate before master
Rich and master Bray Chownes baggs were steeved thene was not convienient
roome enough in the Thomas Bonadventure to have sayd 60. 50. or 40.
sackes of Cotton woolls without steeving of them, unlesse the same were
to be layd in the Craine way which is not usuall or ever knowne to be
done in woolls by reason of the danger of their taking water. And
he beleiveth that not above twenty baggs could then have bene safely
putt on board without steeving. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 16th Interrogatories he saith that when the Thomas Bonadventure came
from Cyprus she could not have carryed thirty tonnes of Cotton woolls
more than were laden in her att that tyme. howbeit hee saith that after
she came to Zant there neere thirty tonnes of Currants laden on board
her in butts, which he saith because [?fezible] by heaving out the ballast
in the hatch way, and thereby making the sayd Currents to forme as
ballast, whereas the Cotton wooll would have required more roome
and would have had need of ballast to be brought safe home. And
otherwise he cannot depose.

To the fourth article of the sayd allegation he saith that being by Profession a mariner
and having bene master and Commander of shipps for the fifteen years
and having made four severall voyages to Ciprus, he knoweth it expe=
rimentally to be true, That Ciprus woolls are putt in very great
baggs, much bigger than the Cotton woolls of other places, by reason whereof
they are stowed with much labour and difficulty, especially after the vessell
whereon they are laden hath receyved any considerable number of
these baggs. And by like experience he knoweth it to be true, that
forty four men in a shipp of two hundred and eighty tonnes in which
100 baggs of Cotton reeles and 400. and odde baggs of galls are
allready laden will find sufficient labour to receive on board and
steive eight baggs of those woolls a day one day with another, and
indeed judgeth, that if they stow and steeve as they ought they can
scarce possibly exceed that proportion, for he saith he hath often seene
that fifty of this deponents owne men in a shipp of larger tonnage

be not able to receive and steeve above eight baggs a day one day with
another. And further or, otherwise, being he was not in the voyage now

To the 10th Article he saith. That by like experience he knoweth that It is very
usuall for shipps in their passage from Ciprus for England to sayle by
Zant aswell to take in Currants into the Crane w&amp;#123;XX) of such shipps which
seldome happens to be full laden att Cyprus, as &amp;#123;f)or the conveniency of
fresh water which is often there taken in, and especially for the safety
and security of the voyage Zant being the likely of place in all the
passage to find Company of other shipps bound for the streights

To the 9th. he saith that one hundred baggs being steeved in a shipp of
280 tonnes, one hundred and seventy baggs more cannot  be receyved
aboard by forty four men and be steeved afterwards, nor can be
receyved on board in six eight or ten dayes, the reason whereof is because
there is not in a vessell of that tonnage, sufficient stowage for so
vast a bulke of woolls without steeving. And otherwise he saith he
cannot depose.

To the 10th and 11th. he saith he cannot depose.

To the 12. and 13th. Interrogatories he saith It is usuall in the steeving of woolls
first to lay a Tier of baggs, and then to steeve in as many more as
are layd in the Tier. And he likewise saith that It is the usuall Custome
to prevent losse of tyme and for keeping the men busyed in steeving
to have a sufficient number of baggs allways ready on the dockes
yet in such a proportion that the worke be not
impeded. in which respect. It is usuall to have about ffifteene baggs

And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the fourth Article he saith that having bene twice att Ciprus hee hath observed
and knoweth it to be true, that woolls there are putt in very great baggs
and are difficult to stow. and by what he hath seene and observed he doth
Judge that the receyving on board and steeving of eight of those baggs a day
one day with another in said a vessell as the Thomas Bonadventure is a
sufficient imployment for forty four men especially after such shipp hath
taken in a considerable number of such baggs, and that a greater number

in case he the sayd Hughes should and did presume to depart without the Convoy and
any losse thereby should befall his shipp and lading he the sayd Hughes should

he ćannot depose.

To the 10th. he saith he ćannot depose, saying that so long as this Rendent stayed
att Ciprus the sayd Captaine Hughes from tyme to tyme expressed his desire to be
gone and not to be willing to stay for the Convoy.

To the xith hee saith he ćannot depose.

To the xijth. he saith That to keepe the men att worke that noe tyme be lost
It is the usuall Course to have baggs of wooll on board still in readines. videlicet
twenty or thirty att a tyme brought from the shoare when the shipp is
empty and afterwards ten or fifteen as the roome in the shipp will
beare and the steeving goes on. And otherwise he cannot answer

To the 14th. he saith that in a shipp of the burthen interrte the number of
baggs to be layd in a tier must be according to the breadth of the shipp
some times 8. 10. or 12. baggs in a tier, and that a tier may by the
number of men interrate be layd in a day. But he saith there ćannot in
such case be so many steeved the next day, in regard the steeving geare
will take up upp much tyme in placing fitt for the worke. so as
generally speaking to teir and steive eight baggs a day one day with another
is held a sufficient labour for so many men in such a shipp as hee before
sett forth. And otherwise he ćannot depose-

To the 15th. and sixteenth Interrogatories he saith he cannot depose.

Captaine Hughes Commander the voyage in question, aged 36 yeares or
thereabouts a witnes produced sworne and examined saith and

To the 1. and 2. Articles of the sayd allegation, This deponent saith, that the arlate shipp
arrived the last tyme att Ciprus the voyage in question to take in her lading the
first day of May 1652 and not before, and had then about one hundred baggs
of cotton woolls on board her and also a four hundred and odd baggs of galls,
And saith that after her such arrivall she receyved on board her about
two hundred and five baggs of Ciprus woolls, which he beleiveth were
all or most of them for the accompt of the freighters, and were all or most
of them laden by the arlate Roger ffooke. And otherwse (not particularly
remembring the number of baggs laden otherwise than as aforesayd, nor certainly
knowing the particular aććompt for who the same were laden, this deponent
attending principally to his owne office and imployment in the sayd shipp) he cannot
depose, saving that there was a report on board as hee saith, that tenne
baggs did belong to one Mr Rich./

To the third and fourth articles of the sayd allegation, This deponent saith that the sayd
shipp was of the burthen of about two hundred and eighty tonnes and had
forty four men belonging to her the tyme aforesayd and noe more. And as
for the Ciprus Woolls arlate, he saith, they are putt in very great baggs
and are steeved with much difficulty after such tyme especially as any
considerable number of them are laden. And he further saith that being
steevador of the sayd shipp, and having undergone that office in other shipps
he thereby knoweth, that forty four men in a shipp of the tonnage aforesayd
having about 100 baggs of woolls and 400 odd baggs of galls on board
before, cannot receyve and take on board and steeve above eight baggs
of Ciprus woolls a day one day with another, And moreover saith that the
Company of the Thomas Bonadventure the tyme arlate did attend diligently
to their labour about twenty howres a day, and yet they did not receive and
steeve above eight baggs a day one day with another, nor could they perfor=
ming their worke as it ought to be done have so stowed above eight a day
one day with another. All which he deposeth for that hee saw the said worke
performed, and was steevador of the sayd shipp as hee hath predeposed. And otherwise he ćannot depose.

To the fifth and sixth articles of the sayd allegation This deponent saith he well concei=
veth that after the sayd shipps sayd last coming to Ciprus there was a great
parcell of woolls in 170. or more baggs laden, and that the last of
them were laden and steeved upon the two and twentyeth of May: 1652
which being done this deponent caused all the steeving geare to be sent on
shoare the next day; and the Company of the shipp fell to fitt their shipp for
her voyage to London whence they intended to sayle assoone as their sayd
shipp could be caulked and fitted which might have bene done in three
or four dayes. And he saith that the sayd steeving geere being so carryed
on shoare, the arlate Roger ffooke and Richard Chowne came to this deponent
and acquainted him that they had two parcells more of woolls to be laden, and
desired him to be carefull in the steeving of them, and prayed him earnestly
to fetch the steeving Instruments agayne on board. And this
deponent att such desire and by the order of the sayd ffooke and Chowne did
fetch the sayd Instruments on board agayne, and they the sayd ffooke and Chowne
sent

To the seventh article of the sayd allegation he saith that presently after such tyme
as the sayd last baggs of wooll were stowed as aforesayd, the sayd
Captain Hughes and company did beinn to sitt and prepare this sayd
shipp and to take her and make her ready to proceed for England.
And he saith that imediately thereupon the sayd Roger ffooke[?] and
richard [?] came on board her and hath of them, in the presence
of each other and of this deponent and other his mates told the
sayd Captain Hughes and Company then on board that they must not
goe away or [?] without the Convoy but must stay and goe with
other (meaning and speaking[?) of the Convoy under the [?]
of Captain Bradily[?]) saying with all that the sayd shipp was better laden
or had more goods in her than her freighters were aware of, and
that Captain Huges must therefore stay for the sayd Convoy and not adventure 
to depart without it, or to the purpose I this deponent being present and 
hearign the sayd advise direction and order of them the sayd [?] and 
[?] as aforesayd and Otherwise he cannot depose.

sayd shipps came away from Ciprus, which was about the ninth day of 
June 1652. the sayd Roger ffoke and Richard[?] Chewnie[?) of the deponents 
sight came on board her. And he the heard that they brought certayne
bills of lading tith them to be signed. And further he cannot depose.

To the 3d. he saith that the sayd shipp the tyme interrate lay about miles from the
shoare, and about a league from the place where the woolls were to bee taken in
And saith that the numbers of baggs interrate might be brought aboard in
ten dayes or lesse, in ćase there were roome enough aboard to dispose of them.
but there was not roome enough in the sayd shipp to recyve so many without
steeving. And otherwise he cannot answer.

To the 4th he saith that the interrate Instruments were not brought away in the said shipp,
but were by this Rendent twice carryed to shoare from the shipp after her returne
from Scanderoone the voyage aforesayd. And this he is sure of And otherwise
cannot depose.

To the 5th. hee saith he hath made onely one voyage to Ciprus being the voyage
in question

To the 6. 7. and eighth. hee saith that the direct Course from Cyprus to England is
directly to the Streights mouth and Zant is something out of the sayd direct
Course, but as the wind stood the voyage in question, the sayd direct course could
not be sayled. And saith the direct Course from Zant to England (as to the
Streights, and Corsica is about 40 leagues out of such direct Course, yet as
the winds often happen to be the Course by Corsica may be assoone performed.
And saith Leghorne is as he taketh it about 25 leagues more out the
sayd direct Course than Corsica is. And further or otherwise hee ćannot
answer.

To the 9th. he saith, that 100 baggs of woolls being steeved in a shipp of the
burthen interrate there is not roome for 170. baggs more to be receyved
on board and steeved afterwards; and that therefore fourty four men
cannot receyve so many on board and steeve them afterwards # And
otherwise he cannot answer.

# but he saith so=
many baggs may
be receyved on
board by degrees
as the steeving
worke goes forward
and in like way for

To the 12th. he saith that in the steeving of woolls it is the usuall Course first to
lay a Tier of baggs and then to steeve in as many more baggs as
are teired, and sometymes more. And the same Course was observed
by this deponent, and his mates in the steeving the woolls interrate. And
otherwise he ćannot depose.

To the 13th. he saith that in the lading of woolls it is usuall to fetch about
twenty baggs some dayes from the shore to prevent losse of tyme and
keepe the men att worke. and afterwards as roome is made by steeving
to fetch more, and still to be ćarefull that the acts of the shipp be not
[?postened] with two&lt;note&gt;read: too&lt;/note&gt; many baggs for feare of tempests, and other inconveniences
as the hindering the men in their steeving and the like. And this Course
was observed in lading the woolls interrate. And further, otherwise than
negatively he cannot answer to this Interrogatorie.

To the 14th. he saith that the order and method of lading wools is thus. first a
Tier of baggs is Layd which in a shipp of the burthen interrate may conteyne
about 13 baggs, and this may be done in about two houres tyme. then the
steeving beames are to be placed, bolted and fixed which worke will
ordinarily require a dayes tyme, afterward,  it is proceeded to steeving
in doeing whereof the number of men interrate may some dayes steive halfe
a dozen or more baggs, and some dayes not above three, and some tymes
not above one by reason of the very great difficulty of  steeving the uppermost
sackes whereof by the violence of the worke sometymes the great ropes

of the steeving geere are burst and other inconveniencies happen
to the great retarding of the worke, so as he saith that ordinarily
the number of men interrate in a vessell of the tonnage interro=
gate may receyve on board and steeve about eight baggs a day
one day with another, And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 15th he saith that on the say interrate there was not roome in the
sayd shipp to have receyved the number of baggs interrate without
steeving, for he saith there was not roome enough safely to have
layd att that tyme one bagg without steeving. And otherwise
he cannot depose.

To the 16th he saith that when the Thomas Bonadventure ćame from Ciprus
shee could not have ćarryed thirty tonnes of cotton woolls more than were
laden in her, howbeit when she ćame to Zant she might and did
receyve thirty tonnes of Currants; the reason of which difference is
from the different qualities of the sayd merchandizes bećause Currants may
safely and well be stowed any where in the hold and in the traveway of
woolls, but the sayd traveway was not halfe long enough to receive such
a quantity of woolls in regard of the great length of the sackes, and
for that Currants are laden without steeving which wools cannot
safely be, neyther ćan be steeved without a sufficient trave way. And
otherwise saving that the sayd Currants were in butts he ćannot depose.

Gregorie Creyk of Marton in the County of Yorke merćhant,
aged twenty four yeares or thereabouts a witnes produced
sworne and examined deposed and saith as followeth videlicet.

To the first and second Articles of the sayd allegation, This deponent saith, That the arlate
shipp The Thomas Bonadventure arrived att Ciprus from Scanderon
the voyage in question, after which her arrivall there
were laden on board her a great quantity of Cotton woolls by the allegat
Roger ffooke English Consull there, of the certayne knowledge
of this deponent, who was then att Ciprus (as he had bene for about four
yeares before) and lived and lodged in one and the same howse with the
sayd Consull, and saw the sayd woolls weighted. but the number of the
baggs hee remembreth not. And the greatest part of the sayd woolls
were, as he then heard, for the freighters of the sayd shipp, and
one smaller parcell was as he likewise heard, for one Mr Rich of London.
And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 3. and 4th articles of the sayd allegation he saith that the sayd shipp the Thomas
Bonadventure was in this deponents Judgment of the burthen of about
two hundred and seventy, or two hundred and eighty tonnes, and had
about the number of men arlate in her the tyme aforesayd, which
number of men, by what he hath seene, observed and heard, during his
sayd four yeares abode att Ciprus, may receyve, and steeve upon a shipp
of such tonnage, about eight or att most nyne baggs a day one day with another
from the first beginning of her steeving till she have recyved her full
Cargo, and not more, the reason whereof he hath observed to be partly the greatnes
of the baggs and their bulke and weight, which renders them
difficult to mannage and steeve, and partly the extraordinary labour that
still encreases as the shipp fills, so as the greater quantity of goods a
shipp hath in her, the more and greater is the labour and difficulty of steeving
wools upon her. And soe much he hath well seene and observed as
aforesayd. And othewise cannot depose/
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.26r Annotate
To the 5th and 6th articles he saith he doth very perfectly remember That after the sayd shipps
such coming to Ciprus the tyme aforesayd, there were Woolls laden upon her by
the sayd ffooke att two severall tymes, and the greater quantity was laden
the first tyme, and that assoone as that greater quantity was laden, the steeving
Instruments were brought a shoare from the shipp, which was then to be fitted
to sayle, which this deponent came to take the more notice of, for that he was to
come in her for England; And this deponent saith, that soone after the sayd Roger
ffooke and the allegat Richard Chowne did give expresse order to the sayd
Captaine Hughes in the presence and hearing of this deponent to ćause the sayd
steeving Instruments to be carryed agayne on board alledging that there
way yet more woolls to be laden, And the sayd Instruments being gott agayne
on board, the sayd ffooke and Chowne did send on board the sayd woolls being
betwixt thirty and forty tackes of woolls, and ćaused the same to be laden
on board the sayd shipp which was done accordingly, this deponent having oććasion
to goe aboard sometymes whereby he saw and knoweth the same ˹were so laden˺ And he saith
that the last of this last parćell to the best of his remembrance were not steeved
till with in two or three daies of the sayd shipps departure which was in June .1652.
And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 7th and eighth articles This deponent saith that he often saw the sayd Captaine Hughes
and his Purser att the sayd Consull ffookes howse to demand bills of lading for the sayd
first great parcell of woolls, which after many delayes they could not nor did obteyne
from the sayd Consull till he had prevailed to have the sayd shipp stay for the lading
of the sayd second lesser parcell. And about the tyme that the sayd second parćell
was lading the arlate Consull ffooke in this deponents presence and hearing
did advise and give order to the sayd Captaine Hughes to stay till Captaine Badily was
ready to depart with his Convoy and for his better security to keepe Company with
the sayd Convoy alledging that it would be good so to doe for the ffraighters
and that they would thank him for it, or to that effect. And this deponent being
on board the sayd shipp together with the sayd Richard Chowne, he the sayd Chowne
gave the like advice and direction to the sayd Hughes which he being not willing to
yeild to, for the desire he expressed to be gone, and the great unwillingness of his
Company to stay, he the sayd Chewne sayd he would gratify the mariners with a parcell
of wines; and then threatened the sayd Hughes that if he would and did depart before the
sayd Convoy he the sayd Chowne would Enter a Protest against him of all dammages
that might befall the merchants freighters by his so doeing. And otherwise hee ćannot
depose

To the 9th article he saith he ćannot depose

To the 10th and 11th articles he saith he hath came masters of shipps say alsXX XXX during his abode att Ciprus that
shipped (such especially of had XXXXXX to take many Currants) did usually ˹they would (for the taking of currants)˺ shape their
Course for Zant, which aswell for conveniency of lading such a heavy merchandize
as Currants as for the winds which often hinder the direct Course is commonly taken
to be the best and securest way. And further he cannot depose saving that after
the sayd second parcells of woolls were laden, the steeving Instruments were agayn
sent a shoare, and the sayd shipp fitted for her homewards voyage.

To the xijth hee saith that he this deponent att the Request of the sayd Consull Roger ffooke
did fetch from the sayd shipp upon her first arrivall att Ciprus from Leghorne a great
quantity of moneyes, which was delivered to the sayd Consull, who did therewith, as
this deponent beleiveth, provide and buy the foresayd woolls or a great part thereof
And he then heard and beleiveth that the sayd moneyes did belong to the merchant
ffraighters, but by whose order the same were sent to the sayd ffooke he knoweth not
And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 13th article he saith he cannot depose::

To the 14th article of the sayd allegation hee saith. That the sayd Roger ffooke during
the sayd shipp the Thomas Bonadventures stay and being att Ciprus as aforesayd, and
after such tymes he and the sayd Chowne had ordered her stay for the Convoyes
aforesayd; did severall tymes in his howse there, and in the presenće and hearing
of this deponent promise and undertake to the sayd Captaine Hughes being then and
there like wise present that he the sayd Roger ffooke would by his advises
certify the merchants freighters, that he had ordered the sayd shipp to stay for
60. and keepe Company with the sayd Convoy: saying then. (as upon other oććasions he
likewise did) that such stay was to the security and benefitt by of the sayd ffreighters
in that the sayd shipp having the protection of the Convoy might and did peave woolls
in her fore peike which otherwise she could not safely doe or to that purpose

And the promise and dećlaration was within the tyme aforesayd att Ciprus made to the
sayd Captaine Hughes by the sayd Consull Roger ffooke att severall tymes as aforesayd,
and upon severall dayes of the certayne knowledge and in the presence and
hearing of this deponent, who then lived and lodged att the sayd Consulls howse
as is above sett forth. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the Crosse Interrogatories [CENTRE HEADING]

To the 1 and 2: Interrogatories he saith he was aboard the Thomas Bonadventure the tyme interrogat
and the sayd shipp and Convoy were then both bound for England, intending to touch
att Leghorne in their passage, and accordingly would as he beleiveth have sayled
if they had not bene hindred. And the fight interrate happened off of Monte Christo, not farr
from Corsica, and Porto Longone (as he thinketh) was the neerest Port being as he iudgeth
about ten leagues from the place where the sayd fight happened. And otherwise he cannot answer.

To the 3d he saith the sayd shipp lay about a league from the place where the Cottons were to be putt in boates
the tyme interrate. and he conceyveth that 170. baggs may be carryed to a shipp so lying in
ten dayes, but not so as to be steeved. And otherwise he ćannot depose.

To the 4th he saith he is certaine that the sayd steeving Instruments were not brought away in the sayd
shipp but were there ćarryed a shore within the tyme interrate.

To the 5th. he saith he lived about 4 yeares att Ciprus, and ćame from thence the voyage in question
on the Thomas Bonadventure, And otherwise or further he cannot depose.

To the 6. 7 and 8th. Interrogatories he saith that as he beleiveth Zant is out of the direct Course from
Ciprus to England, which is by to the Streights mouth, and that Corsica is out of the direct Course
from Zant to the says Streights, and Leghorne more out of the way than Corsica; but
how much the sayd places are out of the way he knoweth not. And referring himselfe to his
foregoeing. depositions cannot further depose.

To the 9th. he saith he hath not any experminentall knowledge in the steeving of woolls, nor ćan
answere certainly and of his knowledge to this Interrogatory. And for what he hath seene
observed and heard in the poynt of taking in and steeving of woolls he referreth himselfe
to his foregoeing deposition. And otherwise cannot answer.

To the. 10th. he saith he doth not know or beleive that the interrate George Hughes did within
the tyme interrate ever promise or say to the sayd Roger ffooke Richard Chowne or any otherthat he would stay for the sayd Convoy, but he did allwayes expresse the Contrary to this Rendent
who otherwise would have come away in the dart or African, and not have stayd for the
Thomas Bonadventure, for his passage for England. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the .11th. he saith he knoweth nothing thereof.

To the 12th. he saith he hath observed that the steeving of woolls is usually done first by
laying the baggs all along one upon another as many as can be so layd (which is as hee taketh
it called a Tier.) and then to steeve as many or more baggs as were so tiered. And
otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 13th. he saith That It is usuall in the lading of woolls to send from the shoare some tymes
on one day and some tymes on another twenty or thirty or more baggs ˹a day˺ aboard the shipp
according as the shipp ćan conveniently receyve them that so upon occasion of bad
weather (which is usuall there allmost every day in the middle part thereof), the Company
may have steeveing worke to doe and noe tyme be lost. And the same Course was as he
observed, used in lading such shipps as came to Ciprus, and so the Thomas Adventure was.
laden as he beleiveth. And otherwise he ćannot depose.

To the .14th. he saith that not having any particular knowledge by experience in the steeving
of woolls he cannot depose otherwise or further than he hath deposed in his precedent
deposition to which he referreth himselfe.

To the .15th. he saith that he was on board the sayd shipp a little before the sayd last parcell
of woolls were steeved, and in this deponents judgment there was not room enough
to receyve 50. 50. or 40. baggs of woolls in the sayd shipp without steeving: and
Captaine Hughes then told the sayd Chowne that he had not roome to steeve any more in the
usuall place of steeving. And otherwise he cannot answer.

To the .16th. he saith he doth not know whethere the sayd shipp when she came from Cyprus
could have carryed thirty tonnes of Cotton woolls more than were laden in her or not if but
he rather thinketh she could not for that the sayd last parcell were steeved in her gunn deck GUTTER
and there did not appeare to be any roome left for more: howbeit he saith that she did
receyve a good quantity of Currants at Zant in the trave way where woolls could not
be steived. but how many tonnes the sayd Currants amounted to he knoweth not. And
further or otherwise he ćannot answer or depose.

To the 7th. he saith there is now way from Ciprus to England for a shipp but
by the Streights mouth; and he beleiveth the Thomas Bonadventure came that
way and any ship so coming, for England must sayle as the wind will permitt
so as if the wind happen to be contrary espécially for any long tyme, as it
sometymes happens, a shipp must of necessity either put into Port
or if she sayle must goe out of her direct Course, some tymes one way some
tymes another way to get advantage of winds, and by meanes thereof
may happen to goe one hundred or more leagues out of the way. And

aged forty yeares or therabouts a witnes sworne and examined
saith as followeth.

To the .5. 6. 7. 8. and 9th articles of the sayd allegation. This deponent saith That the
direct Course for a shipp from Salina Road in Ciprus to England is to
sayle as direct a Course as may be to the Streights mouth, and is by generall
computation five hundred forty five leagues or thereabouts, And that to
goe from the sayd Road, first to Zant and so to the Streights mouth is about
15 or 16. leagues out of the way and so accounted: And he further
saith
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.30r Annotate
saith that the direct course from Zant to the Streights mouth is about four
hundred leagues and so accounted, and to sayle from Zant to Corsico and
so to the Straights mouth is four hundred and ninety leagues and so accounted
which is ninety leagues out of the way. And to sayle to Leghorne and so to the
Streights mouth is about ten leagues more out of the way. By all which it appear=
eth that to sayle from Salina Road first to Zant, then to Corsico, and so
to Leghorne and then to the Straights mouth about one hundred and fifteene
leagues out of the direct Course from the sayd Road of Salina in to the Straights mouth
so as he that keeps the direct Course doth not come eyther to Zant, Corsica or
Leghorne. The premisses this deponent knoweth to bee true by the common and
generall aććompt of Mariners, and by his experience in those seas wherein
he hath made severall voyages. And otherwise hee ćannot depose.

To the 16th. and 17th: articles he saith he hath little skill in the steeving of woolls
but hath seene woolls steeved in other mens shipps att Alicant and Smirna
and did observe that they did lay and steeve about 16 or 18 baggs a day And
further he ćannot depose for the reason aforesayd

To the last he saith his deposition is true
Upon the rest he is not examined by direction of the Producent

To the first he saith he comes to be a witnes in this cause att the request of Mr ffooke and

than negatively cannot answer

To the second he saith he never was att Ciprus steeving woolls. And otherwise hee
ćannot depose.

To the third he saith he never made Ciprus his last Port homewards. and beleiveth
it is usuall for shipps bound for London from Ciprus to goe to Zant unlesse
there be order given to that purpose by the principalls. And further he ćannot
depose.

To the 4th he saith he doth not know the Thomas Bonadventure nor can further
ánswer for the reasons aforesayd.

To the 5th. he saith he knoweth nothing thereof.

To the .6th. he saith he knoweth of noe such usage in the streights as is here
interrogated. neither did he this Rendent. after his shipp hath bene ready ever
stay for Company without direction so to doe from his principalls.

To the 7th. he saith there is noe way for a shipp from Ciprus to England but
by the Streights mouth. and in case the Thomas Bonadventure came from Ciprus
to England he is confident she came that way. And there is noe doubt but that
it often happens that shipps sayling from the Road of Salina meet with crosse
and contrary winds so as they cannot hold the direct Course, but must and
doe sayle this way and that way as they may to gett advantage of wind. And he
saith that in turning to and fro the whole traverse may happen to be or
contayne one hundred or more leagues more than the Course in a direct
lyne when the wind is favourable, howbeit he saith the sayd traverse may
and ought to be made as neere the direct line as may be and never to exceed
six eight or ten leagues or thereabouts from the latitude which is direct to the intent that when the wind proves good the shipp
may still be in her ready way homewards to take advantage of it, which if
she sayle and hundred or more leagues from the direct Course she cannot doe, [#]

shipps to sayle so farr
from their direct
latitude.

tymes he hath bene forced by reason of crosse wind in sayling from those

where the Channell is narrow as about Majorca it happens that the Christian
Shore may be discovered one day and the Barbary shore another day, and
many leagues may in that manner be run[n] more than the direct Course
according to the Continuance of Crosse winds, and ćannot exactly be told but
by him that measures his such severall traverses to and fro: And further
saving his precedent depositions to which he informeth he cannot depose;

To the 10th he saith it is usuall for ffactors to protest against Masters of shipps
that make a breach of their [XX] order by staying or not staying in Port or
otherwise, but that such protests are not allwayes made in those cases
and therefore that it ćannot be concluded that a master hath performed
his duty though noe such protest be made. And further he ćannot
answer.

To the 11th. hee saith that when a shippe is lett to freight, and the factors have not sufficient
lading of the ffreighters goods to lade such shipp, they usually provide
other goods of other men. to make a full freight, which other mens goods
if the factors doe require it, this deponent beleiveth the master in such case is
obliged to receyve on board him, that he may not retourne home whith a dead
freight. for which he would otherwise be lyable to make satisfaction as this
rendent conceyveth. And otherwise he ćannot answere.

To the 12th he saith that having little knowledge in the steeving of woolls he
cannot depose.

To the 13th he saith that the galls as they come from Aleppo are sound, but by being
shott loose, or by dammage happening to them in the shipp many tymes became
rotten, and the sayd merchandize of galls is commonly taken in att Scand Smirna
unweigh'd, this Respondent never seeing any weighed so farr as he remembreth
but how woolls are taken in att Ciprus he knoweth not. And he saith that when
a master of a shipp takes in galls without weight ˹he˺ is not bound as he ćoncey=
veth to deliver them by weight. And for making or not making satisfaction
for such weight as falls short of the entries made by the factories for such goods
receyved in by tale and not by weight, he conceyveth that a master of a shipp
is not in such case lyable to make satisfaction unlesse it appeare he hath embezled
the same. And otherwise refering himselfe to the law in the sayd question
propounded he cannot depose.

To the 14th he saith that the baggs of galls are sübject to breake, and in such
cases the baggs breaking are to be mended or the galls putt in other sacks
by which meanes some small dammage but not to any considerable value
doth often happen, and such inconveniencies ćannot allwayes be avoyded. And
he beleiveth that Cotton Sackes are subject to the like. And otherwise he
cannot depose.

To the 15th he saith he never was &amp;#123;a)tt Porta fferara.

To the 16th. he saith he knoweth nothing thereof.

To the 17th. he saith that if his shipp were ready to sett sayle from Ciprus and
a Convoy were ready there and would depart in some short tyme, he this Rendent
would notwithstanding observe the order of his principalls or ffreighters, and
so doeing conceyveth, he should not be practichable or lyable to satisfy any losse
that might befall by not attending such Convoys; howbeit he saith that if the
factors would sufficiently secure him from his Charterparty and the Convoy would
sayle directly home, he would then, and not otherwise, stay for and attend
such Convoyes And otherwise he ćannot depose

To the 18th he saith he ćannot answer.

To the 19th. he saith he knoweth not George Hughes interrate, and otherwise
cannot depose.

To the 20th he saith he never commanded any Convoy in the Streights. nor doth he
beleive it is the Course for convoyed shipps to follow their Convoy from port
to port much lesse that any obligation lyes on them so to doe, or punishment to the
masters in neglecting so to attend such Convoys; it being as this Rendent concey=
veth very preiudiciall to merchants and the designs for which shipps are made
if it should so be. And otherwise he ćannot depose saying that in all such
cases the best and second way is for a master of a shipp to keepe close to his
principalls orders.

To the xxith Interrogatory hee saith that all Convoys are sent out on purpose by
the State to conduct shipps and secure them from taking, And if he were in a
port ready to depart with his shipp, and a Convoy there that would depart in
six or 14 dayes, he in such case (if his factors would under their hands
sufficiently secure him from his Charterparty and did require him to stay, and such
Convoy would sayle directly home) would stay for such Convoy and come
along with her, otherwise he would keepe himselfe close to his orders and
Charterparty. And otherwise he ćannot depose./

voyage, and having bin in Salina Roade aforesaid, and that such as aforesaid
was and is the direct course from Salina Roade for London, hee saith it was
and is notorious amongst mariners
using that voyage, and places thereabouts.

To the sixth hee saith that in case George Hughes had sailed the
Thomas Bonadventure either from Salina Roade aforesaid directly to the
Streights mouth, or if hee had sailed directly from Zant to the Streights
mouth, hee had not come to Corsica, that being out of the direct waye or course

is about 500 leagues, which is about 80 leagues out of the very direct
way from Zant to the Straights mouth and so commonly accompted. And
such that to saile from Zant first to Legorne and thence to the Straights

day; which is small, especially the first day, and afterwards there
are usually sixteene baggs or more received aboard each day,
which hee knoweth having bin severall times at Cyprus and at

be so many baggs receaved aboard as to lay and steeve as may
amount one day day with another to the 17 or 18. baggs per diem. And
otherwise cannot depose.

To the seaventeenth hee saith that fourtie foure men working
20 houres or but 16 houres in 24 houres. for 12 dayes together
may lay and steeve within that time 170 or at least 160 baggs,
and may receive within the said 12 dayes 50 baggs more (winde and

not sufficient goods of the freighters to lade them withall, for the

Thomas Ashley of the parish of st. Olaves in
Southwarke mariner aged 56 yeares or thereabouts
sworne and examined.

To the first article of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth
that the direct way of sailing to come from Salina Roade of Cyprus for
London is to come to the Streights mouth which hee saith is
publique and notorious to all mariners using these parts
as this deponent hath donne

To
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.33r Annotate [CHECK WHY JUMS TO XITH FROM 1ST ARTICLE]
To the sixth hee saith that if George hughes or any other had sailed any
shipp to goe in a right course from Salina Roade to the Streights mouth, or
to goe or saile from Zant right from the Streights mouth hee or they must not
have come to Corsica, which hee saith is alsoe notorious amongst mariners
using those parts and places for saileing as this deponent hath donne for theise
30 yeeres last, ˹and upwards˺ and therefore thereby hee knoweth speaketh knowingly what hee deposeth
in this behalfe and saith that if the dutch fleete was at Corsica (as the comon
common fame is that they were) the said George hughes in his direct course
of sailing from Salinas Roade to the Streights mouth, or from Zant to the
Streights mouth had not met with themin all probabilitie. And otherwise
hee cannot depose.

To the seaventh article hee saith and deposeth that the direct way to saile
from Salina Roade of Cyprus to the Streights mouth is 645 leagues or
thereabouts and not above, and that from Salina Roade aforesaid to goe first
to Zant and thense to the Streights mouth is not lesse than 662 leagues or
thereabouts, which is 17 leagues or thereabouts out of the way from
Salina Roade to the Streights mouth, which hee knoweth having severall
times and often bin all all these places, and come both immediately from
Salina Roade to the Streights mouth and from Salina to Zant and thense
to the Streights mouth.

To the eighth hee saith that the direct course of saileing from Zant to the
Streights mouth is about fower hundred leagues, and that to saile from
Zant first to Corsica and thense to the Streights mouth is about 490 leagues
which is 90 leagues or thereabouts out of the way of sailing from Salina to
the Streights mouth, (meaning if such shipp saile to the North ward of Corsica
as this deponent hath bin informed George hughes did) And further saith
that to saile from Zant first to legorne and thense to the Streights mouth
is further than to saile from Corsica to the Streights mouth, by 15
leagues or thereabouts, all which hee knoweth for the reasons aforesaid.

To the nineth article hee saith and deposeth that from Salina Roade in
Cyprus to saile to the Streights mouth, and in the sailing to goe to and
stopp at Zant and thense to goe to Corsica and thense to the Streights mouth
is about ˹745 or˺ 750 leagues or thereabouts, which hee saith is 105 leagues and not
X or thereabouts out of the direct course of sailing from Cyprus to
the Streights mouth, all which hee knoweth for the reasons aforesaid.
And further hee cannot depose.

To the sixteenth article hee saith and deposeth that the way and manner
of steeving Cotton woolls is to lay a certaine number of baggs under neath
and as many on the topp of them, and then to steeve in betweene them the
like number of them or more, soe that if there be eight baggs steeved
in a day for severall dayes together; there ought and tis expedient that
the first day when they begin to steeve they should receive 24 baggs, or more
aboard, and still they ought to have daily many more sacks or baggs
aboard than they can steeve that day to supplie occasions, and for as much
as the weather may soe fall out that they cannot goe daily ashore
for their supplies. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the seaventh I think this is a mistake by the scribe árticle hee saith and deposeth that a shipp of the
burthen of 280 tonnes having in her 100 baggs of Cyprus Cotton
woolls steeved, and 400 sacks of galls stowed, may with 44 men take in
with much case 20 baggs more of cotton woolls every day for twelve
dayes together, winde and weather permitting them to be fetcht aboard,

in twenty foure houres daily for twelve dayes may lay
and steeve within that time 160 bagges, and may within the said
twelve dayes (winde and weather permitting) receive 50 baggs
more aboard and steeve them afterwards, if there be soe much
roome in the shipp as to lay and steeve 38 baggs more over and
above 308 baggs of cotten woolls and 400 sacks of galls and
there being left about 30 tonnes of emptie tonnage in the said
shipp. All which hee knoweth having often received and steeved
woolls aboard at Cyprus, and other places and bin present at the steeveing of
greate quantities and assisted therein, and otherwise hee

To the first hee cometh required by mr ffowke and Mr Chowne
as to speake the truth in this businesse, wherein hee hath noe
interest at all, nor will it be any either benefit or disadvantage
therein which way soever the cause goeth.

To the second hee saith hee hath bin at Cyprus six times or
more steeving of cottt cotton woolls, namely first in the
London of the burthen of 500 tonnes and upwards, and carrying
550 sacks of wooll, and upwards, besides many other goods; secondly in the
Mary of the burthen of 400 tonnes, and carrying 370 sacks of

Imployment of the burthen of 360 tonnes. and carrying first
340 sacks and the second time 300 sacks of wooll and much other

To the third hee saith that this deponent hath made thrice made

but to come through the Streights mouth, that ever this deponent heard
of or beleeveth, and hee beleeveth that the Thomas Bonadventure
came that way having noe other way to come. And commonly
it happens that a shipp cannot keepe a direct course from Salina to that
Streights mouth, but must saile sometimes one way and sometimes another
according as the winde is, and the winde taking them right contrary
they may tack sometimes seaven leagues or more on one board and after as many
on the other and may traverse to and fro continually till the winde comes

otherwise hee saith hee cannot answer, not being acquainted with
proteste in the matter interrogated.

To the eleaventh hee saith that still the factor must followe his
principalls order who had rather sometimes that the shipp should come
away halfe laden than stay, but tis true that many times the factor
supplies his principalls emptie tonnage with other mens goods, wherein
it is to be supposed hee hath their procedent order, which the master is not
to dispute, unlesse hee have particular order from the imployers for his
conduct in the voyage- And otherwise hee cannot answer

To the 13th hee saith hee conceiveth that if a master receives the goods
interrogated by weight, hee must deliver them by weight, and this deponent
never tooke in or delivered out Cottons or gauls by weight, but by marke
and number, howbeit they are usually weighed a shore before their coming
aboard. And otherwise hee cannot answere saving as aforesaid, and saving
hee never knew galls come rotten from Aleppo, and saving the factor marine
useth to give or send aboard a factorie of the weight

then aboard to sett sayle with the said shipp towards the Downes, the wynd
being then somewhat too high in his judgement conveniently to unmoore the
said shipp which was done with very great difficultie and trouble, and so
shee came in safety to an anchor in the Hope, and the next morning
being the munday morning ensueing, the said Wilkinson comeing aboard
his said shipp commanded the said Warren to sett saile from thense, to
which hee this deponent knoweth not what the said Warren replyed, but saith
hee well knoweth, that severall of the said Dutchmen were then ashoare

of about 22. men and one boy, And saith the wynd was then very
high at the North-west or neere that point, and the said Warren
was very earnest to have come to an anchor at Lee aforesaid, and to that
purpose had caused to be taken in her foretop saile of the said shipp, but the
said Wilkinson absolutely refused soe to doe or permitt to be done, whereupon
the said Warren was enforeced contrary to his good will and likeing to sayle

water, where her Companie handed the sailes, and brought her to anchor with
two anchors in about 5. or 6. fathom water, and strooke both her yards and
topmasts, but the said two anchors came home, and then the said shipp struck on the
sands, so that the shipps Companie were forced to cutt the Cables, and yet
could not flatt the shipp, but were forced againe to come to an anchor, after
shee had beaten over another sand, and the same shipp grounded at low water
and the storme encreasing they were for the preservation of their lives forced
to cutt away and putt the said shipp on shoare in the flood, which was
done (as this deponent beleeveth) by the said Wilkinsons consent, this deponent not

Cables should be cutt, and that the shipp should pull the other after her to
keepe her head to windward, the same was not obeyed, both the cables being
cutt, but by whom this deponent saith hee knoweth not, And saith, That to the
best of this deponents Judgement the inconveniences that did happen to the said shipp

To the first hee saith hee cometh in the instance of the said Thomas
Browning to speake the truth in this cause, and that hee hath noe
relation at all to him; and saith hee this deponent sawe the said
Browning severall times in the house of the interrate Mr Wilson in
Cadiz about the shipps business, and that this rendent was not in her
that voyage, And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the second hee saith that as hee hath heard the said Thomas
Browning had an Adventure of his owne on board the said shipp
the said voyage, and this deponent holdeth the said allowance of
a peece of eight per day in the case aforesaid to be a duety from the
owners and not a gratuitie, in as much as a master or purser cannot
well be at lesse daily expense on
shoare; and hee doth not conceive that the owners having a factor
on shoare shall not excuse the said allowance, for a master is seldome
or never consigned to a port, where[?in] the owners have not some
factor or other person to give him assistance and that the masters
going ashoare to him and staying there and waiting on him about
the shipps business is for the most part equall expense to him as if there were noe
factor there, and that rate of a peece of eight per diem is a
mans ordinary expense there, and often more than lesse. And

To the 1st Interrogatories he saith that the sayd James Warren hath had the repute
of a sufficient Pilot to conduct a shipp out of this River into the downes
and accordingly hath pilotted severall shipps as that Rendent hath heard
And further having not had any personall knowledge of the sayd Warren
or Experience of his Pilotting before the voyage in question he cannot
answer

To the second Interrogatorie he saith the said James Warren did Pilot the said shipp
and brought her safely to Gravesend, and she was there cleared upon a
Saturday, and the same Saturday might as he now remembreth or the next
morning she was unmoved in order to fall downe to the Hope. And att that
tyme the wind was very high, howbeit other shipps as well of the Exchange
then likewise departed from Gravesend, and the said Warren Pilotted the
Exchange into the Hope without difficulty so farr as this Rendent
observed. And further knowing nothing of the interrogat passages
betwixt the sayd Wilkinson and Warren, he cannot depose.

To the third Interrogatorie he saith that the shipp Exchange was of about two
hundred tonnes burthen and twenty four men are a competent number
to sayle such a shipp upon such a voyage as was then intended and
that there were twenty four men as Mariners in the sayd shipp Exchange
the tyme in question, besides two boyes all being of her company. And [?that GUTTER]
otherwise not remembering to have heard the sayd Warren to have compl[?ained GUTTER]
of lack of men, or that the said Wilkinson threatened him with making or [?threaten= GUTTER]
ing to make a Mutiny or any thing to that purpose, or of any import[?unity GUTTER]
or force used to the said Warren to sayle out of the Hope, he saith [?hee GUTTER]
cannot answere.

To the 4th Interrogatorie he saith that the sayd shipp being upon her sayd voyage
departed from the Hope (to the best of his remembrance) upon a Sunday morning
next after the fore mentioned Saturday, and sayling by the Redsand  [?were GUTTER]
over the fflatts that morning, and att that tyme there blew a very strong
wind from the North west and By west, but the sayd shipp came not to the [XX GUTTER]
narrow nor did edge in as is pretended by this Interrogatorie, but ćame [?neare GUTTER]
to the Woollpack which is out of the narrow, and there struck and left [?her GUTTER]
rudder, after the losse whereof the said shipp beat over that sand
and then cast anchor but not lyeing safely thene, but beating upon
another saw the Cables were of necessity to be cutt, and so the shipp [XX GUTTER]
over that other sands; And he saith it is true that the said Warren did steare [XXX GUTTER]
South East for the Redsand, and did afterwards and after that he [?had GUTTER]
mist or left his Course to the narrow whither he should have gone, [?endeavoure GUTTER]
to edge into the shoare South East and by South but that endeavour be [XX GUTTER]
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.107r Annotate
too late, and there being not above fifteen foot water, the shipp struck and
lost her rudder and was damnified as aforesayd. As for the importunity or force
interrogated, or that the sayd Warren did putt the helme a port, or the sayd
Wilkinson[?s] forcing the helme to be putt hard on starboard hee knoweth nothing
thereof. Neither doth he know what the sayd privat markes are which the sayd
Warren is in this Interrogatory pretended to have endeavoured to bring together.
And further he cannot depose.

To the 5th. he saith the sayd shipp having beat over the sayd Woollpacke came into
three fathom and a halfe water, and then her sayles were furled, and both her
yards and topmast struck, and her two bower anchors cast out, and the wind was
high and her anchors yeilded and gave way, so as the sayd shipp struck agayne
on another sand, and then her sheat ánchors were cutt as aforesayd, and she beat over
that other sand, and then her sheat ánchor was cast out, and the wind increa=
sing the sayd sheat ánchor was cutt in the flood, and the shipp was forced to
shoare, And as for the occasion of the sayd inconveniences and dammages and
who was in fault thereof he referreth himselfe to his foregoeing deposition
And further otherwise than negatively cannot depose.

videlicet.

To the first Artićle of the sayd allegation This deponent saith that about four or
five weekes before Michaelmas last .1655. (the tyme hee otherwise remembreth
not there were laden in the sayd shipp Hope (Martin Barnhide Master) att the

and an halfe of Clapboard, twelve hundred and an halfe of [?keeving]
staves, eighty [?keeve] pipe staves, and three hundred an halfe of oares
all to be transported in the sayd shipp from Quinsborough to London and hence
to be delivered to the respective persons to whom the same were consigned
who were to pay the freight agreed on for the sayd Transport. All which
he knoweth to be true for that he sawe the sayd goods laden, and was att the tyme
of lading told they were for merchants of London in whose imployment the sayd shipp
was freighted, and being Carpenter of the sayd shipp came in her to this Port.
And further (referring himselfe to the bills of lading allegate touching the
merchants and freight) he cannot depose.

To the second article he saith he ćannot depose.

To the third article hee saith that the sayd goods being so laden the Master and Company
of the sayd shipp about three weekes before Michaelmas last (the tyme hee
otherwise

HCA 13/71 f.115v Annotate
otherwise remembreth not) sett sayle therewith from [?Pilloe] Roade arlate
for the Port of London And the sayd shipp was at that tyme a tight
[?stanch] and strong shipp well fitted with sayle masts yards cables anćhors
and all other provisions tackle and necessaries fitting for such a voyage
which he knoweth being Carpenter of her as aforesayd. And otherwise he
saith he ćannot depose.

To the 4th article he saith that from the tyme of the sayd shipps departure from [?Pilloe]
as aforesayd for the space of five or more dayes there happened every day
Contrary winds and stormy tempestuous weather which he knoweth sailing
in the sayd shipp Carpenter of her as aforesayd. And otherwise he saith
he cannot depose.

To the 5th article he saith that about the fifth or sixth day after the sayd shipp Hopes
departure from [?Pilloe] (the particular day of the moneth he remembreth not) the
wind then blowing from the South=Southwest poynt a very violent storme
happened whereby the foresayles of the sayd shipp were carryed away as is arlate
ánd the shipp receyved much water by reason of the high Seas, and she was
forced back by that tempest neere fifteene leagues towards the Pilloe
And he saith that the sayd Master and Company of the sayd shipp did what was
possible to be done for the preserving the sayd shipp and her lading, which by
Gods blessing they did preserve, and after some seven or eight dayes
came into the Sound, and the winds being still Contrary stayd there
about six or seven dayes, which he knoweth for the reasons aforesayd, and
otherwise ćannot depose.

To the 6th article he saith that the sayd shipp after six or seven dayes stay, departed
from the Sound for this Port of London and about three dayes after mett with
a &amp;#123;?most) violent raging storme of wind and tempest from the North North
west, which began about three of the Clock in an afternoone and continued
allnight and to the next day. during which storme the sayd shipp could beare
noe sayle saving her mainsayle which was lett downe very low, and by
three of the Clock the next morning the sayd shipp was driven upon the
Coast of Jutland neere the [?holmes], and there being twelve fathom
water then found there were two anchors cast out one after the other
which by reason of the continued violence of the storme could take noe hold
whereupon the sayd Master and Company for preserving the sayd shipp and her lading
with their owne lives were forced and did cutt downe the maine mast of
the sayd shipp which with the yards sayles and cordage thereto belonging were
carryed overboard into the Sea, and perished and were lost; And then and
not before the sayd anchors caught fast hold, and there the sayd shipp lay [?till GUTTER]
the afternoone of the day att which tyme the wind came to South South [?west GUTTER]
And then the sayd Master and Company to preserve shipp, lading, and their lives
were forced and did Cutt one of their Cables, and one of the anchors did breake
in weighing, and both anchors were lost, onely one peice of one anchor
was haled upp with the cable fastned to the sayd broken anchor: This done the
sayd Master and Company sett sayle for the Coast of Norway to preserve their shipp [?if ?it GUTTER]
might be, and being come neere the Coast the weather grew so darke
that the Land could not be discovered nor any haven found All att length
a fisherman whom they by chance found conducted them into Gasthaven in
Norway. The premisses he knoweth to be true seeing and well remem=
bring the foresayd passages. And otherwise he ćannot depose.

To the 7th article he saith that by the great violence of the sayd Storme and rage of
the sea the sayd shipp received in much water, inso much as there was great danger
of having her swallowed upp in the Sea, by the high Seas that fell upon her
oftentymes. And the sayd Master and Company did all that was possible for men to [?doe GUTTER]
to preserve the sayd shipp. And many other shipps were lost in that Storme [XX GUTTER]
[XXXX GUTTER]

HCA 13/71 f.116r Annotate
appeared as well by generall report as peices of shipps that were seene floating
after their perishing. And this deponent for his part doth verily beleive
that in case the sayd shipp had not bene a strong stanch and able shipp, or in case
her Master and Company had not shewed their labour and diligence as aforesayd
the sayd shipp and all her lading in her had perisht and bene lost by the
extreme violence of the sayd tempest. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the eighth article hee saith that the sayd great mast yards Ropes and tackle, and
sayd Cable and Anchor were lost as aforesayd for preservation of the sayd shipp and
her lading which he knoweth for the reasons aforesayd. And the sayd mast and
other the sayd particulars so lost were in his judgment of the value of four
hundred and sixty six dollars or thereabouts, and that then like cannot be bought
for a lesser sume of money. And he conceyveth that the sayd losse ought to be
borne betwixt the sayd shipp and lading in a rateable proportion. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the ninth and tenth articles hee saith that the sayd shipp being so brought to G[?a]sthaven
could not depart to performe her voyage till she was provided of a mast yards
and other necessaries such as were lost. And none being to be had att Gasthaven
of the sayd Master was forced and did goe to Christian=Saint to provide the same and
there bought a mast, yards two anchors with cordage and some sayles such as hee
could there procure for which (as upon his returne he did affirme and as this
deponent beleiveth he payd about three hundred Rijx dollars, and could not gett
the same cheaper. And he saith that being there in a strange place and having
not money sufficient to pay for the sayd tackle and necessaries he the sayd Master was
forced and did borrow seventy Dollars of the Mariners of his Company: and allso
twenty five dollars of one Evert Penniake a Master of a shipp then att Christian
Sant (as the sayd Master upon his returne from [XXXXX] to Gastaven affirmed) and as this deponent
beleiveth. And this deponent knoweth that (he the sayd Master (still wanting
moneyes to pay for the sayd things) did take a bundle of hempe out of the sayd
shipp being one of the thirty marked as aforesayd, and he (as he sayd) sold the
same for about 80 dollars and could not gett more for the same, five of which dollars
(as he also sayd) were spent in satisfying the Customes and other dutyes for the sayd
bundle of hempe. And the rest together with some of his owne money
and the moneyes borrowed as aforesayd making in all (as he sayd) about three
hundred dollars, were payd for the sayd mast sayles anchors and necessaries above
mentioned. And the sayd mast was brought a board and sett upp and other the sayd tackle
fitted for the performing of the sayd voyage of the sight and certayne knowledge
of this deponent Carpenter in and of the Hope as aforesayd. And otherwise
he cannot depose.

To the xith article he saith that the sayd shipp necessarily lay att Gusthaven about six
or seaven weekes to be fitted for her sayd voyage, and then departed and meeting
with crosse winds was forced to putt into fflackery in Norway and there to
stay about eight dayes, and setting sayle from thence for London was by
contrary winds forced to putt into Newcastle, whither she came about
three weekes before Christmas last and this deponent in her, whereby he
knoweth the premisses to be true. And otherwise he cannot depose

To the xijth and xiijth articles he saith that the sayd Barnhide did att Newcastle hire
a pilot by name John Holland to Pilot the sayd shipp to London, and the sayd Pilot
came on board and though the winds were crosse yet after some dayes conducted
the sayd shipp and lading (the sayd bundle of hempe sold att Christian sant excepted)
safe to Harwich, whither being come there was a man of Warr called
the Hare=pinke which as was there sayd used to Convoy shipps to London, and
an Harwitch Ketch and an Hollands hoy ready to depart for London, and
the
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.116v Annotate
the Company of the &lt;u&gt;hare&lt;/u&gt; understanding that the &lt;u&gt;hope&lt;/u&gt; was bound for London promised
to Convoy her, whereupon the Master of the Hope for avoyding the Dunkirke frigots
and for Company did assent to goe with them, and so stayed not att Harwich
but departed for London with the sayd pilott still on board, And it was in a morning
and the Hare, Ketch and hoy lead the way and the Hope followed them. And in
the afternoone of that day the sayd hare Pinke ketch and hoy being still
on head of the Hope came upon certayne sands off of Colchester, And
the sayd vessells came allso upon the sayd sands and fastned there, And her master
and Company of this deponents sight and knowledge used their utmost endeavor
to gett her off. but could not. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 15th and 16th articles he saith that the sayd Hare pinke soone after she came
upon the sayd Sands brake in peices and was lost, and her Company having but
a small boat and having about thirty two men on board endeavoured to gett the
boat of the Hope, which the Master and Company of her would not part with
and so they endeavoured all that was possible to gett their shipp off, and plyed the
pumpe, and went not to shoare till being past hope and being in feare
to loose their boat by the Company of the Hare, they the sayd Master and
Company of the Hope together with four of the Hares Company that had
gotten into their boat did in the same boat gett to shoare, And otherwise
he cannot depose saving that the sayd shipp Hope had taken in much water
upon the sayd sands before her Master and Company went ashoare as aforesayd

To the 17th. and 18th articles he saith that the sayd shipp came upon the sayd sands about fower
leagues from the shoare, and there was noe towne neere to the place, and only one
poore howse whither the sayd four persons of the Pinkes Company and the Master and Com
pany of the hope came about midnight, and they enquired for helpe to gett their
shipp from the Sands but could heare of none, but within a day or two heard that
some fishermen had gotten the Hope from the Sands and that she was gone for London
whither the sayd Barnhide this deponent and other his mates went to find her And
he saith That att the tyme of the sayd disaster upon the sands all the foresayd goods
laden as aforesayd att Quinsburgh were on board the sayd shipp, and came after
wards to London, and there of this deponents sight were all delivered to the
persons to who the same were consigned (the fore mentioned bundle of hempe

To the xixth. Article he saith that all and singular the dammages which
befell the sayd goods were caused by the fury and violence of the
foresayd stormes and tempests; and by the disaster upon the forementioned sands
and not by or through the neglect wilfulnes or default whatsoever of the
sayd Martin Barnhide or his shippes Company, which this deponent
being Carpenter of the sayd shipp and sayling in her as aforesayd well knoweth
to be true, And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the last he saith That his foregoeing deposition is true.

To the first second and third Interrogatories This Rendent saith he kept noe Journall of the
foresayd particulars, but well remembreth them as is easy to doe after so short a tyme
it being but his last voyage. And saith he expecteth nothing whatsoever to come of
this suit or freight thereby demanded, because he hath receyved ten [??Rijx GUTTER]
dollars for the halfe voyage att Quinsburgh and not returning in the sayd
shipp back agayne is not to have any more, nor expecteth any thing [XX GUTTER]
allso saith that all or most of the hempe aforesayd was wett and damnifyed
and some oares and Clapboards were missing att the delivery but how
many he knoweth not, but beleiveth the sayd Fishermen had them. And saith
that the sayd Barnhide and Company lost their sayd vessell upon the Sands

Gabriel Smell of Lubeck Mariner late Steersman of the sayd shipp
the Hope aged thirty yeares or thereabouts a witnes sworne ánd
examined saith as followeth.

To the first and second Articles of the sayd allegation, This deponent saith, that about the tyme
arlate there were laden on board the sayd shipp the Hope att Quinsburgh arlate
two and thirty bundles of hempe, one hundred of wainscott, one hundred
of pipe=boards, five hundred and one halfe of Clapboard, twelve hundred and
an halfe keeven staves, keepe pipe staves and three hundred and
an half of Oares, all to be transported to London for severall English
merchants att a freight agreed by their Correspondents or factors
at Quinsbourgh, The Premisses he came to know being Steersman of the sayd
shipp this voyage. And further he cannot depose.

To the 3rd. 4th and 5th Interrogatories he saith That the sayd shipp the [#]

[GUTTER XXXXX cables
[GUTTER XXXX and tackle
[GUTTER XXXX XXXXX
[GUTTER XXX And]
[GUTTER XX XXXX] [SIGNATURE, LH MARGIN]

departed with her sayd lading
from the [?Pilloa] soone after the beginning of September, and mett with excee=
ding bad weather and Crosse winds in the East sea which continued many dayes
and was often tempestuous so as in one storme the sayd shipp tooke in much water lost her foresayles
and was driven many leagues backward out of her Course, but came att last
to the Sondt of denmarke and there by reason of Crosse winds stayd about
eight dayes, And then departed from thence. which he knoweth being Steirs=
man of the sayd shipp as aforesayd.

To the 6. 7. and 8th. articles. he saith that within two or three dayes after the Hopes
departure from the Sondt aforesayd she mett with a most feirce and violent storme
the wind blowing from about the Northwest poynt, wherein she was in exceeding
great danger of perishing with he lading. the winds being so high that shee
could beare noe sayle but her maine sayle, which was let downe very low. the
sayd storme he saith began in an afternoone and continued to the next day
and drawe the sayd shipp neere the Holmes not far from Jutland, and there
the water being about twelve fatham two anchors were cast out but could not gett
noe fast hold so as the Master of the sayd shipp Martyn Barnhide and Company
for preserving the sayd shipp and her lading did necessarily resolve and did
cutt downe the mainmast which with the yards sayles and tackle were by the
violence of the wind borne overboard and were lost in the sea, And the next
day after midday the wind changing and coming about thhe Southwest poynt
The sayd Barnhide and Company for preservation of the sayd shipp and
her lading were constrayned to cutt one of their cables, and as they endeavoured
to weigh upp one of their anchors the same broke in peices, so as both the sayd
Anchors were lost. onely he saith a peice of one anchor was recovered. And
then the sayd shipp sett sayle for the Coast of Norway and was att last through much
danger conducted by a ffisherman (whom by chance she mett with) into Gusthaven
arlate. And he moreover saith that by credible report which hee then heard in
Norway many shipps perished in the sayd storme, and so in all probability the
Hope and her lading had done if she had not bene a very strong shipp or in case
the Master and Company of her had not used their utmost industry to preserve her, which
he saith they did as farr as was possible for men to doe. And saith allso that
the sayd mast was cutt and sayd sayles yards ropes and tackle lost, and the sayd anchor
and halfe and halfe cable likewise for preserving of the sayd shipp and lading.
the value of which things so lost he conceyveth to be about four hundred and
thirty dollers, and also beleiveth that the goods being so preserved ought to contribute
towards the sayd losse. And otherwise he cannot depose saving that in the sayd
storme the sayd shipp receyved great quantities of water into her.

To the 9. 10. and 11th. articles he saith That the sayd shipp having suffered so much
in the sayd storme was of necessity to be fitted with what she lacked before shee
could proceed on her voyage for London, To which purpose the sayd Barnhide
(Gusthaven not affording such things) did goe to Christian=Sandt in Norway
and there provided a new mast which was fitted and sett upp, on board
the Hope, and allso two anchors and some sayles and Cordage such as that place
afforded. And he borrowed seventy Rijx dollars of his shipps Company
towards the paying for the sayd things; and had allso some moneyes from one
[?Peninck] (but how much he knoweth not). and allso sold a bundle of hempe
for the same purpose, but for how much he  knoweth not. neyther knoweth he
what the sayd things cost. And he saith that for the fitting of the sayd shipp
seaven weekes were spent, and then she departed for London but was
forced by Crosse winds into Flackery as is allegat and there stayed
about eight dayes, and then comng for England and this Port
of London, the winds att length not favouring, did putt into Newcastle
about the beginning of december last. All which he knoweth being
of her Company as aforesayd. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 12. 13. 14. and 15th articles he saith that the hope stayed att Newcastle about
four dayes in which tyme the sayd Barnhide hired one Holland a pilot there
to bring the sayd shipp to London, which the sayd Holland undertooke to doe
and did after about eight dayes bring her and her lading to Harwich
whither she came in a morning and stayd not there for that there was
the Hare pinke being an English man of warr and a Ketch, and an hoy
then departing for London, and the Captaine of the sayd Pinke promising to
Convoy the Hope to her Port, the sayd Pinke, ketch, and hoy sett sayle and
lead the way, and the Hope followed them having her foresayd Pilott
still on board her, And in the afternoone &lt;u&gt;of the&lt;/u&gt; same day the sayd vessells
sayling as aforesayd came upon the Sands arlate. and the Pinke and Hope
stuck fast. And the sayd Pinke within a small tyme was beaten in peices
and perished, and the Hope stuck so fast that though all possible meanes
were used she could not be gott off. thereupon the Company of the Pinke
being about thirty persons not being able to gett all safe a shoare in their
owne boat which was but small did endeavour to gett the Hopes boat which
the sayd Barnhide and Company would not part with, but, desiring to stay by
their ship to loose her if possible, kept their boat to save their owne
lives if the case should come to extremity. Of the premisses he was an eye=
witnes and otherwise cannot depose.

To the 16. and 17th. articles he saith That att length four of the Hare pinkes
Company gott into the Hopes boat, and acquainted the sayd Barnhide of the danger that
might befall him if the rest of the Hares Company should take his boat from
him, saying that they did intend so to doe, whereupon the sayd Barnhide and
his Company finding their endeavours to gett their shipp off the Sands to be
fruitlesse, and being sollicited by the sayd four persons as aforesayd did with
them goe to shoare in their sayd boat. And the sayd shipp Hope before her
Master and Company so left her had receyved much water in her hold, the
Premisses he knoweth being then present aboard her. And otherwise he cannot
depose, saving that the sayd disasters happened about three leagues
from shoare, and that it was midnight before the Hopes boat with the people
in her came to shoare, and saving that there was noe towne there and but
one little howse, and that noe helpe could be heard of to gett off the sayd
shipp from the Sands, and that afterwards there was newes that some ffishermen
had gotten her loose and were carrying her for London whereupon the sayd
Barnhide and Company came up to this Port.

To the second article of the sayd allegation This deponent saith that the sayd shipp
being so fitted att the Bermadaos sett sayle from thense for England
and had a Pilot on board her to conduct her safe from the sayd Island
howbeit he saith that about the second day of November &lt;u&gt;1655&lt;/u&gt; the sayd
shipp by reason of the wind which proved more scanty than was expected
(not withstanding the diligence and Industry of the sayd Pilot then on board
her) did strike upon some rockes, which occasioned so great a leake in
the sayd shipp (for the space of two dayes and nights especially) that the sayd
Master and Mariners could scárce keepe her from sinking although
they did use their utmost diligence by pumping to keepe her dry
which he knoweth to be true being Masters mate on board her as aforesayd

To the third article of the says allegation hee saith that about the beginning of the

Susan and Anne when she began the sayd voyage from the Barbadaos
for the sayd Port and before the sayd Hurricano and disasters befell
her as aforesayd, was a stanch and able shipp and sufficiently provided
for such a voyage. And the goods he saith were all well stowed and
dennaged, but the water came in in so extraordinary a manner when the
mayne mast was cutt downe that it rann downe into the hold and wasted
much of the sugars, and the heads of many of the Casks, being as should seeme
not so well fastned as they might have beene, became loose and fell out,
which losse and dammage he saith he could not be avoyded. And hee
saith that the lossening and falling out of the topps or heads of the sayd Casks
and the dammage and losse that before the sayd sugars was caused by the
violence of the sayd Stormes, and disasters aforesayd. and not by any fault

Company of the sayd shipp were enforced and did for the preservation of
the sayd shipp and lading and their owne lives, cutt downe their
mainmast. and the foremast hee saith was carryed away by the violence of
the Storme. and so much water came in betwixt deckes that the weight
thereof did endanger the oversetting of the sayd shipp for preservation
whereof a hole was of necessity to be cutt to lett the sayd water into

as were necessary, and being provided of a Pilot departed from there
and about the tyme arlate (having her Pilot on board) the winds
proving scanty struck upon a Rock whereby she tooke a leake, and the
pumpe was afterwards very carefully plyed to prevent dammage as much as
might be; And he further saith that afterwards the sayd shipp
having her sayd lading still on board and being not farr from the
Coast of England about three dayes before Christmas last mett with
a very violent storme, which for the tyme it continued was of such
force as that it rent and carryed away the greater part of the sayles

that the goods and lading of the sayd shipp were well and sufficiently

he was Carpenter of and sayled in the sayd shipp the voyage in question
and thereby knowes, that the sayd shipp under the Command of George
Boys arlate departed with her lading of sugars from the Barbadoes
bound for this Port of London in the month of August last past and
that afterwards being upon her Course a violent storme or Hurricano
mett with her which carryed away her foremast, and brought in great
store of water betwixt her deckes, and putt shipp and lading and
the mens lives into such danger that to prevent their utter perishing
the sayd Boys and Company were necessitated and did cutt downe their
mainmast, and allso to cutt a hole that the water might passe into the
hold for feare the shipp should otherwise have bene oversett, and that the
pumpes might be able to worke, And saith that the sayd Storme did
continue neere three dayes, and in very good extremity for the
greater part of that tyme, by reason of all which the sayd shipp
was forced to putt in to the Bermudaos there to be fitted agayne
for her sayd voyage, which was done accordingly, and a Pilott
hired to conduct her from those islands, howbeit he saith that the
wind Scanting upon the sayd shipp she did (notwithstanding the diligence
of the sayd Pilot to prevent it) strike upon the rockes, and so caught
a leake, so as much water came in and very great dammage might
thereby have happened had not the Mariners diligently plyed their
pumpes, which hee saith they did and so preserved the sayd shipp and her
lading, the sayd disaster of sinking upon the rockes happened as hee
saith about the beginning of November &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; last past. And further
saith that when the sayd shipp being on her Course for London came
neere the English Coast she mett with a feirce and raging storme
which carryed away the greater part of her sayles and putt her in
great danger of perishing. Of all which this deponent was

sayd shipp when she so came from the Barbadaos was an able and stanch

and lading on board her were well stowed and dennaged; And saith
moreover that the sugars became much endammaged by the water that
came into the sayd shipp by meanes of the stormes and disasters aforesayd,
which sayd dammage hee saith did wholly happen by reason and occasion
of the sayd storme or Hurricano, and leakes so caused as aforesayd

The foresayd Stephen Allen examined
upon the Crosse Interrogatories administred on the behalfe of Mr
Smith's Clyents saith as followeth. videlicet.

To the first Interrogatorie he saith that George Boys aforesayd did speake to him
to be a witnesse in this cause, but he cometh to testify the truth by the
order of this Court as he conceyveth And that he was masters mate
of the sayd shipp, and hath not receyved all his wages for the voyage
in question, saying that the sayd Boys hath attached forty pounds of
his wages in the Poultry Counter, pretending that he hath so done under
colour of dammage sustayned by goods, brought home in the sayd shipp
Susan and Anne. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the second Interrogatory he saith he is sure that a good quantity of the sugars
were damnifyed and washt away in and by the sayd Hurricano. howbeit
he saith he doth beleive some of the sugars were dry and well conditioned
after the sayd Hurricano, but how much was wett and hurt, or how much did
continue dry after the sayd tempest was over he cannot particularly
declare. And he further saith that the sayd shipp was leaky after the sayd
Hurricano and before she struck upon the rockes as aforesayd, but not so=
much as she was after her such striking. And such striking he saith did
happen by the Scantines of the wind as aforesayd, and not by the unskill
fullnes of the Pilot, beleiving that as the wind then happened
to be the same would not have bene prevented by the ablest pilot. And
otherwise he cannot depose.

To the third Interrogatory he saith he doth not know that whether the sayd sugars
and goods were well conditioned or noe att the tyme of their lading
being they were brought aboard in caskes which he saw not opened
And saith that some of the sugars (but how much he cannot say) was hurt
and damnifyed att the tyme of their arrivall here, but to whom the sugars
so damnifyed did or doe belong he saith he knoweth not. And
further or otherwise cannot answer.

which the sayd Boys doth deteyne under pretence of dammage susteyned
by certaine sugars brought home in the sayd shipp. And otherwyse
he cannot depose.

To the second he saith that some of the sugars were wett and damnifyed in the sayd [?hurricano GUTTER]
and some as he beleiveth remained dry. And saith that the sayd shipp by
the said hurricano did become leaky: and by striking on the rockes became [?much GUTTER]
more leaky. and that she struck upon the rockes not by the unskillfullnes
of the Pilot but by a sudden Gust of wind that unexpectedly came against
the shipp whereby her former wind that was fair to have carryed her from
the Islands became scanting upon her. And he beleiveth that the sayd [?strike GUTTER]
could not have beene prevented as the wind then happened. And otherwise
he cannot answer./

after she [?struk] upon the Rockes she became much more leaky

suddenly athwart her, and brought her former wind scanting upon
her. And otherwise he cannot answer

Jan Polo of Flushing in Zealand Mariner aged 51. yeares
or thereabouts a witnes sworne and examined deposeth and
sayth as followeth. videlicet.

To the 1. 2. 3. 4. and 5th Articles of the sayd allon he saith he cannot depose.
saving that the sayd shipp the Hope came and arrived at Elsineur in the
Soundt of denmarke in September 1655 last past, where this deponent
att that tyme was expecting some shipp whereon hee might come as a
Passenger to theis Seas and saving that the shipp Hope had hempe Clapboard
and deales on board her,

To the 6th. article of the sayd allegation he saith, That on or about the 29th
day of the sayd moneth of September, the foresayd shipp the Hope
sett sayle from the Soundt aforesayd under the Command of Martin
Barnhide as Master of her, And about four dayes after being upon
her course for London there happened a very high and violent
wind from about the West North west poynt in the afternoone, so
as the sayd shipp could not nor did beare any other sayle but her maine
sail very much lowerd, And the says wind increasing the night following
there happened an extraordinary furious storme, which by two of the
clock the next morning drave the sayd shipp neere to Jutland
upon a place called the holmes. and upon sounding it did appeare
that the sayd shipp had then about thirteene fathom water, whereupon
being allso neare to the Lea shore the sayd Master and Company
for the preservation of the sayd shipp and her lading did cast out
two anchors one after the other the first anchor by reason of [?the]
violent fury of the sayd Storme not taking hold; and after both were
cast out they could not yet hold, so strong and raging was the sayd
storme, so as the sayd Master and Company for preservation of the sayd shipp
and her lading were enforced and did cutt downe her mainmast
which with the yards sayles and tackle thereto belonging was immediately
carryed by the sayd Storme of wind into the sea and so perished, and
then and not before the sayd Anchors did take hold and fastened
themselves. And the shipp lay so att Anchor till the afternoone of
that day att which tyme the wind shifted something to the Southward.
And the sayd Master and Company were forced and did cutt one of the
Cables, and endeavoured to weigh the other anchor but it brake in
weighing. and one perice of it was recovered; and the rest of it as
also the other anchor were lost. And that night the sayd shipp with much
adoe andwith great danger came to the Coast of Norway, and was by
a ffishermans yall conducted betwixt the Rockes to a small haven called

ćame a passenger in the sayd shipp from Elsineur and saw and
was an eyewitnes of the premisses. And otherwise cannot depose

To the .7th. article he saith that during the foresayd storme the sayd shipp did
receyve great quantityes of water, and did often shipp whole seas
together. And the sayd Master and Company plyed the pumps, and were as
carefull as men could be each one in his place to preserve the sayd
shipp, her lading and themselves, being all in extreme danger of
having bene swallowed upp by the sea. And there were three
shipps lost in the sayd storme upon that Coast as this deponent after=
wards heard who saw them driven upon Jutland and did then
conclude that they could not probably escape persihing. Of the
premisses he was an eyewitnes in manner as aforesayd being a Passenger
in the sayd shipp. And otherwise he ćannot depose, saving that he [XXX]
beleiveth that in case the sayd shipp had not been an able and strong
shipp (as she was) or the sayd master and Company not industrious (as
they were) the sayd shipp with her lading and men on board her had
all perished in the sayd storme:-

To the 8th he saith that the sayd mast yards sayles tackle cable, and anchors were lost
in manner as aforesayd for preservation of the sayd shipp and lading, and
were of the value of one hundred and fifteene pounds sterling in
this deponents Judgment. which by the experience he hath had in sea
affayres for theis six and thirty yeares last past having bene
Master and allso Steirsman of severall good shipps, doth allso
hold it for certayne that by the Custome of the Seas and lawes of
Oleron the sayd dammage is and ought to bee putt into an average be=
twixt the sayd shipp and her lading aććording to a rateable
proportion. And otherwise he saith he ćannot depose.

To the 9. 10. and 11th articles of the sayd allegation, he saith that by reason of the
premisses the sayd shipp was unable to proceed upon her voyage for London
till she were supplyed with such things as she lost. for which [?purchase]
the sayd Barnhide (Gusd not affording[?e] supply in that kind) did repair
to Christian Sandt and there f[?a]rnish himselfe of a mainmast yards
sayles anchors and tackle which were afterwards sett upp and fitted in
to the sayd shipp, And one bundle of hemp was taken out of the sayd
shipp and sold towards the payment of the sayd necessaries so provided as this
deponent beleiveth. And after six weekes stay which were spent in
providing for and fitting the sayd shipp as aforesayd, she departed for London
but by Crosse winds was driven into fflackery and there was forced to
stay about a fortnight, and then departed for London and in her course
the wind falling short putt into Newcastle in the North of England [?att]

Hope stayd att Newcastle about a weeke as he remembreth, and there the
sayd Barnhide hired a Pilot by name John Holland to conduct his sayd shipp
for London And the sayd Pilot comeing on board brought her safe to
Harwich after about nine or ten days, whither the sayd shipp was putting
in to enquire for a Convoy, but stayed not there, for that the Hare pinke
being a small Man of warr with two other small vessells were then
conveing out bound for London, and the sayd Hares Company understanding
that the Hope was also bound thither wished there to sayle with the
sayd shipp Hope: And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 14th. 15. and 16th articles of the sayd allegation This deponent saith that the sayd
Hare pinke and two other vessells lead the way and the Hope followed them
having her sayd Pilot still on board her, And towards the night of
the same day whereon they departed from Harwich the sayd vessells
came all suddenly and unexpectedly upon the soands called the Middle
ground and three of them stuck fast videlicet the sayd Convoy. a Dutch hoy
and the sayd shipp Hope. and the sayd Convoy or Hare pinke soone after
splitt asunder. And the master and Company of the Hope used all the
endeavour that might be to gett their shipp loose, but all in vayne. And
the Company of the Convoy finding their pinke splitt and being
many men and having but a weake boat would have gotten or
borrowed the Hopes boat which was good and strong, but the sayd Barnhide
and Company considering the great danger they were in night being now
come upon them refused to part with their boat, howbeit three or four
of the pinkes Company sprang into the sayd boat, and more would have
come in if they had not bene hindred, where upon they went off towards
the sayd hoy in their owne boat, and the master and Company of the Hope having
very great feare that they would returne and furnishing themselves
with weapons out of their pinke (which was not yet wholly sunke) and
taking the Hopes boat by force, and not seeing any probable hopes of getting
the hope loose from the sands, did goe to shoare in their boat together

five or sixe howers continually before the said shipp was freed of the said five
foot water or therabouts, and that shee had a maine saile and a foresaile out at
such time as shee received the said water, And saith, the reasons that the water
did not come to the Chaine pumpe as is interrate were for that the said shipp
was stoaked, and the boards of the well being nailed very cloase and swelling
hindred the passage of the water, soe that it could not come [XXXX] or otherwise
than it was drained through the ballast then aboard the said shipp. The

sayle and foresayle, abroad at the time of the casualty aforesaid, And
saith, the reasons, as this deponent conceiveth that the water came not to the
said chayne pumpe were because the said shipp was then stoaked, and for
that the hole above the timbers of the said shipp was stopped by the meanes
of the water and dirt comeing in over the said shipps ballast and that

on board without any particular Contract or Agreement. And otherwise

of Ipswich water interrate. And further, saving his foregoeing deposi=
tions to which he referreth himselfe, he cánnot otherwise than negatively

to him this Rendent. But he saith he knoweth not, nor can depose for
whose accompt the sayd goods were, nor the quantityes of them, or their kind
and quality otherwise than as aforesayd, nor the value or price of them
or any of them. And this Rendent sayled with the sayd hoye and goods in
her towards Ipswich and cáme to anchor off of the [?Spilts] waiting for the

in the night tyme the storme increasing broke the cable, and drave (sic) the sayd
hoye upon the Coast of fflanders neere to Graveling where being forced
upon the sands she was bilged, and thereby she and her lading [XX XXXX] lost. And
otherwise he cannot answer.

to the fflandrian shoare in manner as aforesayd. And he beleiveth that the sayd

was a vessell imployed for trade betwixt this Port and Ipswich att a
freight certayne for goods putt on board her. and accordingly the sayd
Complayne was to have payd for his goods. and would have done as hee doth
beleive. And he saith It is true there was an Embargo or stay of all
shipps by order of State att such tyme as he went with the sayd hoy
for Ipswich out of this River of Thames: and that he, (the sayd Order
notwithstanding) not having victuall sufficient to stay till the sayd Embargo
was ended, did in the night tyme gett out of this River with the sayd hoy and
goods in her. but there was not any shott att all made at or after him from the Blockhowses so farr as hee heard. And hee was forced by
stresse of weather upon the fflandran shoare neere Graveling as aforesayd. And he saith that
after the sayd vessell was bilged the souldiers and others from
Graveling (but without this Rendents consent and wholy against his will)
did by force seize upon the sayd goods and carryed them ashoare, into
some Church or other place, whither this Rendent was not permitted to

of them to the [?Governal] of Graveling, howbeit hee saith It is true,
that upon this Rendents addresse to him for releife and succour hee did
give him this Rendent fourteene pounds sterling which this Rendent
did receyve and hath since payd the same to the sayd Complaine.
And otherwise he cannot answer.

had a Mariner and three boys in her, and him this Rendent. And that
the sayd Mariner was not turned out of her by this Rendent, but was
imprested for the service of the Commonwealth And att that tyme
By reason of the presse this Rendent could nott gett another
Mariner in his stead but was forced, to returne for Ipswich with
the sayd boyes. And otherwise he cannot answer.

Cooke the Master severall tymes say and affirme, and allso that the most
of the Mariners had signed to a written Agreement to that purpose
and saving now veiwed and perused the schedule to the sayd allegation

name thereto as now it appeareth) that the sayd schedule was and
is the originall written Agreement, touching the premisses. And
otherwise he saith he cannot depose.

To the second article of the sayd allegation this deponent saith that att the sayd shipps
arrivall in Norway the sayd Batsons and Companies factor there did
putt on board the sayd shipp forty five horses or thereabouts for their

Barbadoes And the sayd James Cooke and Maynard Johnson as mate
and Boatswayne were by their places to looke unto and have
care of the stowage thereof, and to see that the Stanchions in which
they were to be placed were Strong and good. And they had and
were provided of such materialls for that purpose as they sayd were
good and sufficient and there was enough of other boards spars.
and materialls to have made the sayd Stanchions more strong and
they might have had them if they had pleased of the certayne knowledge
of this deponent who was then there as merchant of the sayd shipp
and had provided such materialls as were strong and sufficient
and they the sayd James Cooke, and Maynard and the rest of the
Mariners concerned in the stowing of the sayd horses did refuse to
make use of them, saying that such as them had was sufficient. And
otherwise he cannot depose.

being so putt on board, the sayd shipp Tankervale putt out to Sea
and soone after upon the shipps working, the stanchions in which

fell one upon another, and thereby one killed another and all of
them dyed except one horse and the sayd Cooke and Company
instead of goeing with the sayd shipp to the Barbadoes brought
her to Newcastle, of all which this deponent was an eyewitnesse
and beleiveth that they so came to Newcastle without the order
of the sayd Richard Batson or any other of the Owners of the
sayd shipp. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the fourth article This deponent saith that upon the sayd shipps coming
to Newcastle there was advertisement given to the sayd Batson
and Company of the sayd shipps being there and of the losse
of the sayd horses. whereupon this deponent afterwards received
a letter from the sayd Batson and Company directed to him this
deponent and the sayd Robert Cooke wherein they ordered the
sayd shipp to come about to the hope in this River of Thames
there to be fitted with such things as shee needed for her

shipp when the sayd James Cooke and the sayd Maynard were imprest

To the sixth article of the sayd allegation he saith he ćannot depose, being not
well acquainted with the worke and duty of Mariners att sea.

To the seventh article of the sayd allegation This deponent saith that for
the reasons aforesayd he knoweth it to be true, that the onely
cause of the losse of all the sayd horses was because the
Stanchions were not made strong as they ought to have
bene, and as they might have bene had they whom the stowage
did ćoncerne made use of the sparrs which this deponent had
provided for that purpose, which he saith were strong and
good. And he is well assured that in case the sayd Stanchions
had bene made as they so ought and might have bene the
sayd sayd horses had bene preserved. And further hee saith that the
care and lookeing to the making of the sayd Stanchions did
properly belong to the sayd James Cooke and Maynard Johnson
as mate and Boatswayne, which hee knoweth by the observation
he hath made of the dutyes of Mates and Boatswayns in the
like ćase, for many yeares that he hath used the sea as a merchant
And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 8th. article of the sayd allegation This deponent saith that the sayd Batson
and Company by reason of the losse of the sayd horses have suffered

himselfe as a Passenger on board the sayd shipp Tankervale Robert
Cooke mate which was designed to goe from this Port to Norway
and there to take in horses and to goe to the Barbadoes and
from thence to returne for England, and by this meanes came to
heare and know that all or most of the Mariners belonging to the
sayd shipp and particularly the sayd James Cooke and Maynard Johnson
were to have their wages payd att the Barbadoes in Muscavadoes
sugars att the rate of four pence per pound; to which purpose hee did
severall tymes see the foresayd schedule in the hands of the sayd

And there was materialls sufficient to have made the sayd Stanchions strong
enough in case they would have made use of them. But he
saith the sayd Stancheons were made too weake and insufficient
and indeed so weake that soone after the sayd shipp was gone to sea with
the sayd horses, the sayd Stanchions did breake downe, and the
sayd horses by reason of such bad stowage fell one upon another
and so one killed another and all of them dyed one horse
onely excepted all which he knoweth for that he was a Passenger
in and on board the sayd shipp and saw the premisses so fall out
and heard this precontest William Tickell offer the Master and
Mariners of the sayd shipp strong and good sparrs which he
had provided some where of he brought aboard, for the making
the sayd Stanchions stong and sufficient, but they refused thee some
saying the stanchions they had made were strong enough, or to
that purpose. And saith that the Master and Company did
not proceed on to the Barbadoes but came to Newcastle, which
as this deponent hath heard and beleiveth was without order
of his Owners. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the fourth article hee saith that the sayd Owners being Mr Batson and
Company (as by letters which he hath seene he came to know) and having
notice that the sayd horses were lost and sayd shipp receyved some
hurt and was come to Newcastle, ordered her to come into this
River of Thames neer to Gravesend there to be supplyed of what
she wanted and so to proceed on her sayd intended voyage. And
otherwise he cannot depose.

To the fifth article of the sayd allegation he saith it is not usuall to impresss the
mates or Boatswayne of any shipp being upon a voyage, and
in case any such be prest it is usuall upon their making knowne
their imployment to release them and accordingly he saw that
the sayd James Cooke and Maynard Johnson having bene once prest
were released presently upon their making knowne their offices

on board upon the sayd persons were last pressed, and submitted thereto
without returning to their respective imployment on board the
sayd shipp.

To the .6th. article of the sayd allegation he saith that the sayd Maynard Johnson
did behave himselfe Stubbornely and perversly on board the sayd
shipp not onely neglecting and refusing to obey the Masters Commands
but discouraging his fellowes in their dutyes, and particularly saith
that whilest the sayd shipp lay att NewCastle he heard the Master
call to him the sayd Johnson to call upp the Company to assist att the
removing of a stage for the Carpenters who went there doeing some
repairs to the sayd shipp, and heard the sayd Johnson refused to
call them, and heard him allso say, that the Mariners were fooles
if they gave their assistance or to that purpose. And further he
cannot depose.

To the seventh article hee saith that the losse of the sayd horses was caused by
and through the weakness and insufficiency of the sayd stanctions which
were, not made so strong and sufficient as they ought to have
bene, as as this deponent for the reasons aforesayd knoweth they
might have bene; and the oversight or care of making the
sayd stanctions strong did properly belong to the sayd James Cooke as
mate, and sayd Johnson as Boatswayne. And he doth verily beleive
that in case the sayd stanctions had bene made so strong as they
ought and might have bene the sayd horses had not perished, but had
bene preserved. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the 8th article of the sayd allegation, this deponent saith hee doth verily
beleive by what he hath seene and observed being a planter in
the Barbadoes as aforesayd that the sayd horses so lost in case they
had come safe to the Barbadoes would have yeilded a thousand
pounds Sterling. And that the sayd Batson and Company over
and besides what might have bene made of the sayd horses have
suffered losse, and dammage by the means aforesayd to a good value, but how much in
certayne he ćannot sett forth. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the ninth article hee saith the sayd James Cooke was and is a young
man of the age of twenty yeares or thereabouts, and is by repute
the sonn of the sayd Robert Cooke the master, by whom hee was

Maynard Johnson as Boatswayne of the sayd shipp; And hee
saith that there were boards and materialls enough to have made

tyme after the sayd shipp was putt out to Sea from Gottenburgh
with the sayd horses, the stancheons in which they were placed did
all or most of them breake, being made, as then appeared too weake,
and thereupon upon the working and rolling of the sayd shipp
in the Sea the sayd horses fell one upon another and beat and
killed one another so as all of them dyed and were left, one onely
escaped, which he knoweth to be true being then on board the
sayd shipp in the quality aforesayd. And afterwards the sayd Cooke
the Master and Company brought the sayd shipp to Newcastle leaving
the direct course for the Barbadoes without the order or knowledge.
of the sayd Batson and Company as hee beleiveth. And otherwise

received upon the like occasion, which primiage hee saith, belonged to the
Masters and Companies of the shipps soe employed, and was usually
allowed and payd unto them, without any pretence made thereunto by the
Owners of such shipps, And further saith hee cannot depose./

To the first Interrogatories hee saith that hee this rendent was an is Captaine
of the shipp the hannibal of london aforesaid, and that hee never
made a voyage from Portugall to the Brazeele interrate; And
therefore hath nothing more to answer to the other demands of this Interrogatorie./

To the second hee saith that this rendent hath credibly heard that Masters
of shipps upon Brazeele voiages have beene necessitated to give
double wages, and wages and halfe as they could agree, because it is an
extraordinary voiage for English men to adventure upon in regard of
the unholesomenesse of that Climate, and dangers [XXXXXXXX] they are
exposed by the Portugalls enemies; This deponent not knowing nor having
ever heard that such great averages as are allowed in such voiages

Master of shipps making such agreement as is interrate, doe usually make
them at Lisborne, their Owners being for the most part here in London, but
beleeveth the averages in such Cases are usually regulated proportionable
to the freight more or lesse, and that it is not in the Masters power to
make the averages higher then the Custome there in due proportion to
the freight allowes them./

The tenth day of May &lt;u&gt;1656,&lt;/u&gt;

On the behalfe of the sayd)
Mr Body)

Examined upon the sayd Libell

Rp. 2.

Edward Boddy of London merchant aged six and twenty yeares
or thereabouts a witnesse sworne and examined saith
and deposeth as followeth. videlicet.

To the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth articles of the sayd Libell, This
deponent saith, That being att Teneriffe one of the Canarie Islands in
the moneth of September &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; last past he then and there receyved a
letter of advise from the arlate fferdinando Boddy bearing date
from this City of London in &lt;u&gt;July 1655.&lt;/u&gt; last past, wherein amongst
other things, hee did certify this deponent, that he had taken to freight
a certayne shipp called the Little Mary George Dennis Master (being
the shipp and Master arlate) on a voyage from this Port of London
to Ireland and go to the sayd Island of Teneriffe, where she was
to be laden with wynes by him this deponent and one Mr David
Stephens (who was then likewise att Teneriffe) and so to returne
for London. for which cause he doth verily beleive and is well
assured that hee the sayd fferdinando Boddy did really take
to freight the sayd shipp as is arlate and as in the sayd Letter
of advise he did as aforesayd signify unto this deponent. And
otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the seventh, eigth, ninth, tenth eleventh twelveth and thirteenth articles of
the sayd Libell This deponent saith that he did expect the sayd shipps
Little Maryes arrivall att Teneriffe in Oratovo road with a lading
of herrings beefe and pipe staves from Ireland, and the foresayd
letter of advise did intimat to this Deponent that the sayd
shipp was to bring such like goods thither. And he likewise
saith that a certayne shipp whereof one Joy (as he remembreth his
name) was master arrived safely att the Canaries from Ireland in the
month of October &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; last past And further
that he hath credibly heard and beleiveth it to be true that the sayd
shipp Little Mary did take in herrings beefe and pipestaves att Waxford, and
that she afterwards came to ffalmouth and that the sayd beefe and
herrings att the tyme of their delivery there were much damnifyed.
And otherwise or further hee cannot depose.

To the fourteenth article he saith he doth beleeve that in case the little Mary
had departed from this Port in the end of July or beginning of August last and
had gone directly for Wexford and so the Canaries without delay and losse
of tyme she might have finished her sayd designed voyage by the end
of October last or within some short tyme after. And otherwise
he cannot depose.

To the fifteenth article of the sayd Libell This deponent saith that in case the
sayd shipp Little Mary had arrived with her lading of herrings beefe
and pipestaves att Teneriffe in good condition, the sayd intended voyage
she
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.204v Annotate
she had undoubtedly come to a good markett for hee saith that in the
monethes of September October and November &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; Irish herrings
well conditioned did yeild in the sayd Island eighty ryalls per barrells
or thereabouts, and Irish beefe well conditioned did yeild a Ryall
per pound or thereabouts, and pipestaves of Ireland did yeild
after the rate of a thousand ryalls per thousand or thereabouts, and
so much and after that proportion the sayd Lading of the Little
Mary (provided the same had come well conditioned) would then and
there have yeilded. which hee knoweth for that he was in the sayd
monethes in and upon the sayd Island and well saw and observed
the currant price of such commodities. And otherwise hee ćannot depose

To the 16th article of the sayd Libell This deponent saith, that the quantity of
goods sayd to be laden in the Little Mary att Waxford. videlicet. two hundred
forty three barrells of herringes, six thousand weight of beefe, and
eight thousand pipestaves in case they had come safe and well conditio=
ned to the Canaries the sayd intended voyage, would there after the
rates above specifyed (which were common and ordinary prices) have
produced seventy pipes of Canary wynes or neere thereabouts, which
he knoweth for the reasons aforesayd and for that he observed the
then ćurrant price of wynes there, and hath computed what might have
bene so produced. And he further saith that in december and
January &lt;u&gt;1655&lt;/u&gt; last past. Canary wines did yeild in this Citty thirty
four pounds per pipe, and that was then and still is an ordinary
price for such wynes which he knoweth being a merchant trading
ánd dealing in such merchandize in this Citty, when, hee arrived
in december &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; last past. And otherwise hee ćannot depose.

To the 17th. article of the sayd Libell This deponent saith that the sayd fferdi=
nando Boddy over and besides what the sayd goods would have
produced had about seventy pipes more of Canary wines there
provided which were ready and prepared and designed to be laden
on board the sayd shipp the Little Mary in case she had come thither
as was expected by this deponent, which wynes were not brought
home, but are in eminent danger of being lost to the sayd fferdinando
Body, in case they be not allready seized and lost, which yet is very
probable. And saith that in case the sayd last mentioned pipes be seized
the sayd fferdinando Body will thereby be endammaged five hundred pounds
att the least, And though they should happen to escape seizure (which is
not probable) yet he by leakage, losse of markett and ordinary
dammage in the quality of the sayd wynes in that they could not be sent
for England will be endammaged four hundred pounds or thereabouts
in this deponents Judgment[?es] who did assist in the providing of the
sayd wynes. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 18th article of the sayd Libell, hee saith, that in case the sayd shipp Little
Mary had so performed her designed voyage as this deponent expect
and beleive she might have done, she might have taken in her lading att
the Canaries and have bene gone from thence very probably before
the
Embargo came thither; however he saith in case shee had not come
[XXXX GUTTER]

HCA 13/71 f.205r Annotate
soone as to prevent the Embargo, yet there was liberty obteyned by this deponent
ánd the sayd Stephens on the behalfe of the sayd fferdinando Boddy
for her to take in goods in case she ćame after the Embargo, and
to that purpose Dutch dispatches and [?pays] were provided to have bene
given to the master of her to have taken in her lading quietly
ánd freely without danger: And aććordingly of this deponents
sight and knowledge by such like meanes severall English shipps
were laden and departed from the Canaries in safety after the sayd Embargo
came thither. And otherwise cannot depose.

To the 19th article of the sayd Libell, This deponent saith, that whilst hee
stayd att Teneriffe (from whence hee came in November last and not before)
severall English shipps arrived att the Canaries, which as was then sayd
and as hee beleiveth came from this port toward the latter end of August
&lt;u&gt;1655&lt;/u&gt; last past. And the sayd shipps receyved their ladings of wynes
there and are since arrived safely in England. And so might the
sayd shipp Little Mary have done had she proceeded upon her sayd
designed voyage, as this deponent for the reasons aforesayd is well
assured. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the 20th hee saith he cannot depose further than as aforesayd.

To the 21th article he saith, that the sayd fferdinando Boddy by the
meanes aforesayd in that the sayd shipp did not proceed upon her sayd
designated voyage, and in losse of his outward market, and wynes they
which his goods might have produced and losse of the sayd seventy
pipes or thereabouts provided as aforesayd (in case they be lost as is most
probable for the reasons aforesayd) hath suffered dammage in this
deponents Judgment and estimat to the value of two thousand
pounds sterleing or more thereabouts. And otherwise hee saith
he cannot depose.

To the 22th. 23th. and 24th. articles of the sayd Libell. he referreth

To the first second, third fourth, fifth sixth and seventh articles of the sayd

of September &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; last past, and being then resolved upon a voyage
for the Canaries, The arlate fferdinando Body did acquaint this
deponent that he had taken to freight a certayne shipp named the
Little Mary (being as he conceyveth and beleiveth the shipp arlate
one George Do[?mes] being master, And that one White had putt in [?another GUTTER]
Master, upon a voyage from this Port to Waxford (whither the sayd
shipp as he then told this deponent was gone) there to take in a
Lading of herings, beefe ánd pipe staves, and to transport the same
to the Canaries, where she was to deliver the same to one Mr St[?ephens GUTTER]
and by him or his meanes to be reladen with wynes for England
she being to returne to this Port. And the sayd Body gave this

shipp that came from Ireland, and was departed from the Canaries before
this deponents arrivall there (which was in November &lt;u&gt;1655.&lt;/u&gt; Last past)
brought and left newes touching the sayd Little Mary that shee was [?laded GUTTER]

she was to come to the Canaries, upon all which grounds this deponent

sold att eighty Ryalls per barrell. and beefe att one hundred and
forty Ryalls per kintall which is neere a Ryall and halfe per pound. and
pipe staves att a thousand Ryalls per thousand. and att such rates the
lading of the Little Mary if they had arrived in good condition att
the Canaries whilst this deponent was there might have bene sold. And
otherwise he cannot depose.

To the .16th. article of the sayd Libell he saith that whilest he he was att the
Canaries as aforesayd the price of wynes there was from three hundred
and eighty Ryalls to four hundred sixty two Ryalls per pipe according
to the quality of the wyne. So as he beleiveth that two hundred forty
three barrells of herrings six thousand weight of beefe and eight
thousand pipestaves (in case the sayd shipp Little Mary had brought so
many thither within the tyme aforesayd) being sold att the rates above
specifyed might and would have produced about seventy pipes
of Canary wynes or rather more. And otherwise he cannot depose
saving that he bought wynes att the Canaries the tyme aforesayd some att
340. some att. 360. some att four hundred. Some att 462. Ryalls per
pipe and that att his returne to this Port he found the price of wynes
of the Canaries here some att six and twenty some att four and thirty
some att thirty seven pound sterling per pipe.

To the .17.th article he saith that the sayd Mr Stephens had att the Canaries about
fifty pipes of wynes in readines which he intended to have laden on
board the Little Mary over and besides what the foresayd goods would
have produced, which the sayd shipp not performing her voyage, are
still there to the great preiudice of the sayd Mr Body for whom
they were intended, of some of which this deponent tasted, and saith
they are in danger to be utterly lost by reason of the sayd shipps not
comeing according to expectation, which if they be lost it will be to the
damage of the sayd Mr Body neere four hundred pounds. And he
likewise heard the sayd Mr Stephens speake of twenty pipes more which
he did intend (as hee sayd) to lade in the sayd vessell Little Mary for the
sayd Body.

To the 18th article of the sayd Libell he saith that in case the sayd shipp Little Mary
had as was expected come to the Canaries there was license obteyned for her
to have sold her goods and laden wynes on board her and dutch
dispatches were prepared in readines for her to that purpose which this
deponent there saw and read within the tyme aforesayd which were so
had and obteyned in regard of an Embargo upon English shipps and
goods. and by vertue of the sayd License and Dutch dispatches the sayd vessell
Little Mary (had she come thither) might have bene laden with safety
the sayd Embargo notwithstanding as severall other English shipps

To the first second third and 4 th articles of the sayd allegation he saith that
he this deponent being Master and Commander of a shipp called the Bettie of Kingsale
in Ireland was at sea taken by certayne Brest men of warr and carried into
Galisia in the King of Spaines dominion and from thence travailed by
land into ffrance to Rochell and from thence came a passenger home
for England in the arlate ship the Willing mynde and saith she came
from the Island of Saint Maytine neere Rochell in company of other Merchants shipps on the 25th day of March last under convoy of the Saphire and Constant Warwick arlate for
prevention of danger of being taken by dunkirke man of warr and the
men of warr enemies of this nation, And saith that in her course toward
England found stormy weather happened, and the sayd Convoyes so being
shorte of victualls made what haste they could for the coast of England
and the shipp Willing mynde was thereby forced to beare sayle then
ordinary, to keepe company with the sayd convoyes, and thereby prevent danger of being taken by man of war, and he saith the sayd shipp the Willing
Minde (though she were otherwise of this deponents sight and observation a
a stronge and tight shipp) by reason meerely of her bearing sayle to
keepe company with the sayd Convoyes and by reason of the weather was som what
stormie was [XXXX] and did receive water into her holds, which the Master and Company could
not prevent although they kept the pumpe continually goeing and did their
true endeavour of this deponents sight and knowledge to prevent all damage
which might happend to any of their ladeing, soe that hee is well assured
that the if any damage happened to any of her ladeing it was not through
any defect or fault of the shipp, nor of her Master and company, but only
by her being strayned with bearing over much sayle, which shee was then constreyned

To the first article of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth that
hee well knoweth the arlate Christofer Page and hath soe donne for
a yeeres last past, and alsoe well knoweth the
shipp the Samuel of London, of which hee saith the said Page was the
time arlate master and Part Owner, and for such commonly accounted
and reputed, which hee knoweth because hee this deponent in that time
served Carpenter in her, under the command of the said Page, who
executed the said Master shipp upon her.

To the second, third and fourth articles of the said állegation and the schedul[?e?s GUTTER]
annexed, hee saith and deposeth that the said Christofer Page in the moneth
of August last past, came to this deponent and told him that hee was
freighted to goe with the said shipp from this port to Teneriff to lade wines
and thense to retourne therewith to this port to deliver the same and [?asked GUTTER]
this deponent if hee would goe his Carpenter, whereunto this deponent
condescending, the said Page hired and shipped him to goe the said voyage
Carpenter of the said vessell, and this deponent goeing upon the said shipp
entered into pay on or about the thirtieth of August last, on which day
shee departed from Gravesend, and in or about the end of September or
beginning of October last shee arrived in Laratavo in the said Iland of
Teneriff, where hee saith shee was by mr Rayden and this order lade [?n GUTTER]
with an hundred and twelve tonnes of wine (accounting two pipes to the
tonne) which my Rayden was accounted therein the factor of the arlate mr
Bass; And saith that after the receipt of the said one hundred and
twelve tonnes of wine on board, there was roome to have stowed two or
three tonnes of wine more, which the said Page offered and was ready to
receive aboard, in case it had bin tendred or ready to have bin laden, and
soe much more the said shipp might have taken in conveniently, and having
left sufficient stowage for her victuall and provisions, all which hee
knoweth because hee was Carpenter of the said shipp and helped to stowe
the said wines soe laden, and sawe the premisses soe donne. And otherwise
hee cannot depose, saving the said shipp might all probabilitie have
brought both the said wines so laden, and the said other two or three tonnes
in case the same had bin laden, in safetie to this port, the danger of the seas
excepted.

To the fifth hee saith the said shipp the said voyage staid on Laratavo in
the said Iland of Teneriff the space of fourtie five dayes or neere thereabouts
and would have staid longer, in case the factors had desired it, and would
have put any more lading aboard her, which hee knoweth for the reasons
aforesaid, and saith there were not any more wines tendered or offered to be
laden aboard than what shee received as aforesaid.

To the sixth 7 and 8th hee saith that on or about the eight and twentieth day of
November last the said shipp with her said wines so laden aboard her
departed from Laratavo aforesaid for this port; where shee a[?rriving GUTTER]

mr [?Bosse], saving what was leaked out by occasion of a greate storme
that the said shipp met with in her said homewards voyage

the company verily thought that both the shipp and they should have bin
cast away, the said storme continueing tenn or twelve dayes together

and saith that whatsoever dammage or leakage hath befallen any of

the shipp (which was otherwise very staunch and tight), nor by any neglect of the
master or any of the mariners, who all did their utmost for the preservation
of the said wines, as hee saith it more than ordinarily concerned them, their
owne lives being at stake. And otherwise cannot depose, referring
himselfe for the freight to the Charter partie made betweene the parties

To the nineth hee saith that after the said shipps arivall in this port and
before any deliverie of any of the said wines, the said shipp and storage of
the wines were viewed by two experienced and honest masters of shipps
who declared that they found the caskes to be well stored (as in truth this

must needs have bin occasioned by fowle and stressie weather and not otherwise.

they began to put such their resolution into acte and did begin by order of

for that the same being measured at
Zant on shoare there was a great quantitie of it found to bee wanting
to the quantitie of three hundred bushells of Corne or thereabout all
as this deponent beleeveth having seene the Accompt taken by the factors of the sayd ffarrington at

which was left to the sayd ffarrington the lader and Owner

unladen, to send some one of the Company of such shipp as
unladeth the sayd Corne, with the same a shoare to see the same
safely delivered and measured and take Accompt of the measure
thereof thereby to prevent imbeazelling and stealing thereof, did
thereupon advise the Master of the sayd shipp the George Bonadventure

Company thereupon did take Accompt
of the sayd Corne but only went in the boates with it to the

damnified by the water taken in at the sayd shipps hatches And
saith the sayd Corne soe wanting was at his this deponents
estimate and judgment worth fower score pounds sterling or there
abouts and soe much hee esteemeth the sayd ffarrington
to be damnified thereby And further to these articles hee
cannot depose/

To the 5th article of the sayd allegation hee saith that while the
sayd shipp George Bonadventure was at Zant the voyage afore
sayd this deponent went alonge with the Master of the sayd shipp
on shoare to the Providore or Governour of Zant who told the sayd
Master in this deponents presence to this effect that hee had caused the sayd
shipp to bee hyred by the arlate Signiour Mavaradino to goe a
voyage to Cassandra and thence returne to Zant and asked the
sayd Master and this deponent whether they were willing to goe the sayd
voyage, whereto they answered yes, they were willing to goe if they
could get the rest of their Company to goe that voyage, whereupon the
sayd Providore bidd the sayd Master and this deponent goe and move it to his
Company which hee accordingly did and saith the Company being
by the sayd Master and this deponent demanded whether they were
willing to goe the sayd voyage the arlate Nathaniell hutchinson
the Masters mate replyed and sayd hee would not goe that voyage
upon any termes, and the like answere was returned by Beniamin
dimmock the other of the sayd Masters Mates as alsoe by the
Boatswaine Christopher Neck aforesayd John Godden
henry denby and others of the sayd shipps Company whereupon
the sayd Master and this deponent went to the sayd Providore and
acquainted him that the Company and especially the sayd Hutchinson would not goe that
voyage but whereupon the sayd Providore sent Mr John Gifford
and Thomas dobson merchants of Zant to persuade
the sayd hutchinson and the rest of the Company to goe the sayd
voyage but hee the sayd hutchinson and the rest of the Company still
refused to goe and the sayd hutchinson told the sayd Gifford
and dobson, that if the Providore sent a noate for him
hee would goe to him and give him his reasons why hee would not
goe and the Providore afterwards sending a noate for the
sayd hutchinson hee refused to goe, at least did not goe to the
Providore, and thereupon the sayd Master and this deponent
returning

returning aboard the sayd shipp found the gunnes of the sayd shipp traversed
fore and afte and the Company of the sayd shipp in a mutinous
and turbulent posture although there were noe meanes of force used to cause them to goe the sayd voyage and the Master askeing what was the
reason the gunns were traversed the sayd shipp Company told him
that the Providore had sent a noate for the sayd hutchinson and
that they were not willing to goe the sayd voyage to Cassandria
and therefore did it in their owne defence, by reason of which
tumult of the sayd Company the sayd Marvaradino who had
hired the sayd shipp for the sayd voyage came not on board
her, and soe the sayd voyage became wholly lost and further
hee cannot depose saving hee saith hee this deponent heard
the sayd Marvaradinoes saye that hee had contracted with the
factors of the sayd ffarrington for the sayd shipp the sayd voyage
for two moneths certayne, and at the rate of seaven hundred
twenty five peeces of eight a moneth, and soe at or after that rate for any longer tyme
the sayd shipp should bee above the sayd two moneths in
the sayd Mavaradinoes service, and saving the sayd ffarrington was
in this deponents Judgment and estimate by the meanes aforesayd of the sayd Companyes not goeing the sayd
voyage damnified to the value of fowerteene hundred and fiftie
dollars, and was forced to lye at anchor at Zant at
great Cost about two moneths tyme in which tyme she might
(as this deponent beleeveth) have performed the sayd voyage./

To the 6th hee saith the sayd
Mavaradino did in or about the moneth of October 1655 take
the sayd shipp to freight of the factors of the arlate ffarrington
for two moneths certaine, at the rate of 725 dollars a
moneth, and after that rate for a longer tyme to goe to Tunis
and there lade Corne and returne therewith to Zant and the sayd
Maravadino was to lade aboard the sayd shipp at Zant a
good quantitie of dollars to pay for the sayd Corne soe to be
bought at Tunis And in order to the sayd shipps goeing the sayd
voyage this deponent did take order to have her provided with
all things necessarie And this deponent ordered the sayd shipps
Company to about the 22th of October 1655 to take the shipps

hee was in drincke and did not know that hee had abused him untill
hee was afterwards informed thereof and saith that those
mutinous actions and carriages of the sayd shipps Company being
publiquely talked of and taken notice of in Zant the sayd Mavaradino

to Zant, and therefore hee would lade noe moneys on board her unlesse
the sayd Master and this deponent would give him security by
some residing at Zant to performe the sayd voyage faithfully
for that hee feared the Company of the sayd shipp being
soe mutinous and disobedient might runne away with the sayd shipp
and money or goods therewith bought, which the sayd Master and
this deponent not being able to give or procure there, the sayd

the sayd dymock and other the persons before deposed of were very
disobedient to the Command of their Superiors and prone to
mutinie upon light occasions and did divers of them goe
ashoare upon their owne pleasure and will without any leave given

Lee after the sayd Otters soe waveing to them to heave up did accordingly, give
Command to his shipps Company to heave up that for the Samuell might come
to Leewards of the sayd Otters shipp, and the Company of the Samuell in order to
the Command of their sayd master did brace up the helme with all speede to come to the leeward, and
braced their mayne sayle, and mayne top sayle in the winde, and brailed up their
Mizen sayle, and used all possible diligence to get
cleere of the sayd Otters shipp and to prevent doeing any dammage to the sayd Otters shipp

sayd Waring in a wilfull and crosse manner commanded and
caused the sayd shipps Company to sett up the mayne sayle, and
would not come to an Anchor as he was desyred to do, by which
his obstinancie and willfullnes the winds blowing strongly the
sayd shipp was soon after severall tymes violently struck upon the sands
, and thereby lost her Rudder and was otherwise very much
hurt and damnified, and the sayd Waring seeing the Rudder lost
and the winds continued high, then and not before caused the sayd
shipps company to bring her to an Anchor among the sands, he
not being able then to governe her for want of the Rudder, and

deeper place to Anchor in and having gone as far as as they durst

sheate Cable and runne the shipp againe before the winde

damage done to the sayd shipp and losse of her Rudder and Anchor and
such dammage as happened to the sayd shipps goods and provisions

therefore they would take the shipp alsoe alonge with them, for their
Owners were able to paye both for the shipp and and wines or to that effect
And further to this article hee cannot depose /

To the 7th hee saith that after the surprizall of the sayd shipp

mett with the Endeavour and tooke her, but finding she had noe wines
and that her ladeing consisted of pipe staves, they lett her goe again, and that
they would not have medled with the Endeavour if her ladeing had not
bin wines for that they knew there was pease with France before they

would be made prize for trading on the English plantations, to which
hee answered it was more than hee knew, for when hee came out
of fflushing, his masters (speaking of his owners or Imployers)
said nothing to the contrary but then hee might trade there, there having
other shipps come out before him from fflushing bound for the Barbada's and other

deponent that the said shipp the Golden parrot before this
deponents meeting with her, had bin at the Sandepoint in the
English Plantation there, and had taken in a greate deale of tobacco then
from the English there. Moreover this deponent asking the said
master (John danielson) why hee had not brought an order from the
States of Holland, prohibiting him to trade in the English plantations
as well as [?harman drougt] had donne, hee answered that if
hee had knowne that hee would not trade at the English Plantations
hee would have gotten the same order. And lastly saith that at the
time of the said seizure the said shipp had aboard sugar, tobaccoe,

that in the moneth of May last past and about the nynth or tenth days thereto
the arlate shipp the March of Ipswich rode at Anchor in the River of
Thames neere New Crane takeing in ballast in a fitt and convenient
place where shipps usually ride at Anchor to the like purpose, And that
the lighter the Ellen and Anne lay fast moored to the sayd shipp
Mary and this deponent and one davies and one Thomas Gibbs and
one Tayler all labourers hyred to that purpose by one William [?dugdale]

cauvse and coming still neerer, this deponent and the other labourers called out to the Company

to lower their sayles and beare to the southwards thereby to prevent
falling fowle of the Mary and the sayd lighter, which notwithstanding
the Company of the Thomasin and Alice refused to doe an answer

Clay which they tooke off some barrells of new beere brought aboard
the Mary which not with standing this deponent and the sayd other labourers
wrought about the [XXXX XXX] almost up to the middle in water to heave out the rest of her ballast
into the Mary thereby to lighten the sayd lighter and keepe her from
sinking, all which hee saith was occasioned by the willfullnesse of
the Company of the Thomasin and Alice in not lowering their sayles and
bearing southward as they were desyred, they habing tymely notice soo to
doe, and well hearing such notice as by their obstinate answere
aforesayd plainely appreared, and saith that the sayd shipp Thomasin

taken care not to fall fowle of the sayd lighter and might easily have
avoided the same if they would habe endeavoured soo to doe, And
further to those articles hee cannot depose/

To the third article of the sayd allegation hee saith that the

Shipp the Owners Adventure had upon or about the second day
of June 1656 last past brought the sayd Shipp within five two or three
leagues of Bell poynt and the sayd Port of Bell Point then

Adventure into the harbour of Bell sound arlate, this hee deposeth
of his owne hearing sight and knowledge being Quartermaster and
Steward on board the shipp Owners Adventure at the same tyme And
saith hee beleeveth if the sayd Damerell had soe fastned to the Ice
hee had gained Bell sound by that meanes And further cannot
depose hee not having gone any voyage to Greeneland before the voyage
in question and therefore not soe well experienced in the advantage
thereof as the sayd Goslin Maudrey and others of the Company and
the harponeeres were, yet saith hee is the rather induced to beleeve
that the sayd Damerell might by fastneing to the Ice when hee was
neere Bell point have gained Bell Sound for that hee heard
the sayd Damerell him selfe saye to one Mr Kirton who was an
Overseer on board on behalfe of the Merchants who imployers of the sayd shipp
Owners Adventure that hee feared hee should not have such an

and the shipp whereof the arlate Child was Master till about the fifteenth
of June last upon or about which day all the sayd shipps began to worke
into the Ice togeather and with much difficulty by reason of the thickness
of the ice did in about twenty fower howers worke about seaven leagues
and not above into the ice and not being able to gett any further the
sayd shipps made all fast to the Ice board and board one of another
and soe laye about sixteene howers and saith that upon or about the
seaventeenth of June the sayd Damerell went on board the shipps of
the sayd Welch and Golding but what conference hee had there with
them hee knoweth not and saith but saith hee well remembereth that
whilst the sayd Damerell was on board the sayd Goldings shipp hee
heard him call out to the Company of his the sayd Damerells shipp

leaning

leaning over the quarter of his the sayd Gouldings shipp called to the arlate
Richard Maundrey and sayd thus or the like in effect videlicet Dick I thinke
your Master (meaning the sayd Damerell) is madd to endeavour to worke
his shipp further into the Ice when there is noe possibility of gaineing
the harbour by reason of the abundance of Ice and great danger in
striveing too much And saith the sayd Pybus Golding Welch and Child
did of this deponents sight and knowledge give over endeavouring to gett
further into the Ice and went out with their shipps to Sea which notwith=
standing the sayd Damerell still persisted in his resolution of endeavouring
to get further into the Ice and commanded his company to gett their
boates in a readines to towe her in further into the Ice and then
the arlate Goslin (who was belowe deck when the sayd Goulding
spake the words predeposed of to the sayd Maundrey) came up from betweene
decks and speakinge to the sayd Damerell sayd thus or to the like effect
whether doe you intende to goe with the shipp and the sayd Damerell thereto
replyed and sayd what is that to you I looke not upon you (meaning the
sayd Gosling) as one to bee made acquainted, whereupon the sayd
Gosling answered thus or the like in effect I was told by Mr Batson
(meaning Mr Batson the party in this cause) that you nothing
should bee done by you of any great concernement without the advice
of your mates and of the harponeeres, and this is of soe great concernement
that it may endanger the shipp and all our lives and priudice the voyage
for ought I see, and therefore I pray consider of it for I beleeve
there are as able men in the other shipps (meaning the sayd Goldings
Welches Pybus and Childs shipps) who have given over attempting
to passe further into the Ice as any are in ours, and would as willingly
endeavour the advance of their voyage as wee would ours, and if
wee leave our Company (meaning the Company of the sayd shipps)
wee may repent it too late whereupon the sayd Damerell being
vexed at the sayd Goslings speeches did in an angrie manner
call the sayd Gosling rogue and pimpeing rogue and sayd that
hee looked upon him (meaning the sayd Gosling) but as upon one of his
Cabbin boyes all which the sayd Gosling did beare with much
patience and did not saye or doe any thing soe farr as this deponent
did or could heare see or observe which might bee preiudiciall

sayd shipp and further to these articles he cannot depose.

To the 7th and eighth articles of the sayd allegation hee saith and
deposeth that of his this deponents sight and knowledge the arlate Maund[rey GUTTER]
and Gosling during all the sayd tyme the sayd shippe Owners Adventure was
workeing further into the Ice than where the other shipps aforesayd were, did
take great paines and helpe to to towe in the sayd shipp whose soever they [might GUTTER]

Commands of the arlate Damerell in working her into the Ice nor encourageing
any other of the sayd shipps company to disobey his commands or refuse
to work thereabout soe farr as this deponent could or did heare or observe,
and they and the Company having wrought the sayd ship further into the ice
by about four myles the the other shipps aforesayd were, the said Damerell
commanded the sayd shipp to bee fastned to the ice and there make a staye
which being done attending to his Command, the sayd shipp layd still there
about twelve howers and in the tyme she did soo laye the sayd Damerell
sawe some fish spoute among the Ice neere where the sayd shipp laye and
cryed out to the company a whale a whale and commanded the sayd
Maundrey and Gosling and the rest of the harpooneres to manne their shallops and make
after the sayd ffish which they did, and comming up with the sayd ffish
found them to be certain ffish called Jubartas, which are a fish the
English use not to fasten upon by reason of their swifte motion and for
that they are of smale profitt and more dangerous to deale with than
whales are; which the Company having discovered did not strike at
the sayd fish but returned aboard the sayd shipp and acquainted the
sayd Damerell what sorte of fish they were, whereupon the sayd Damerell
commanded the sayd harponeeres and this deponent and others of the
Company not to hawle up any of their shallops upon the ice nor
hoyst them up upon the shipp sides for that (as hee sayd) he thought the
other shipps (meaning the sayd shipps formerly in Company of the
Owners Adventure and from which she had gone further into the Ice)
were working out of the Ice to make to Sea, and willed some of
the Company to stepp up upon the shrowdes to see whether the heads of
the sayd other shipps laye to seawards or noe, and thereupon this deponent
and one John Engle went upon the shrowdes to take view and told the
sayd Damerell that they discovered the sayd shipps head to be to

they (meaning the sayd shipps) are workeing out of the Ice to goe to Sea
and soe will wee also, and thereupon Commanded the sayd shipps company to
goe into their boats and work the sayd shipps The Owners Adventure and Greyhound out of the Ice
to sea to followe the sayd other shipps which they did accordingly and saith
that noe words or actions of the arlate Manndery or Goslin (soe farr
as this deponent could or did observe) were any cause why the sayd
shipps Owners Adventure and Greyhound was not then or at any tyme after put into port
but the same in this deponents Judgement was occasioned only by the extremity
of the Ice and sea and by reason the shipp was gone too farr to the
Northwards of the harbour of Bell Sounds and the winde contrary
and saith that the sayd shipp being by order and Command of the
sayd Dammerell wrought out of the ice to sea the sayd Dammerell
when she was gott clear of the ice and at sea standing by his owne
Cabbin did in the hearing of this deponent sayd he was glad the sayd
shipp was gotten out and that hee would not bee in the Ice with her
again for five hundred pounds or hee spake words to the same effect.
The premisses hee deposeth of his own sight and knowledge being on
board the sayd shipp as one of her Company and assisting in performance
of the things predeposed according to the sayd Damerells commands. And
further hee cannot to these articles depose.

To the 9th hee saith he well knoweth the arlate Pybus Welch Child
and Golding and hath so knowne them for these five years last or
thereabouts during which tyme they have used the ffishing trade for Greenelands
as master of shipps and one accoumpted men very well experiensed therein And saith that
of his this deponents sight the sayd Pibus his shipp after her getting
out of the Ice was in great danger of sinkeing in so much that his Company
were about to forsake the shipp if they had not bin assisted by the helpe of
this deponent and the sayd Gosling and others of the Adventures Company
who after they were gotten alsoe out of the Ice seeing her in distresse
and staying for helpe went to her assistance, and saith the occasion
of the sayd Pybus his shipps danger was by reason that by her goeing
into the Ice (though she went not soe farr as the Adventure did) the Ice
had broke a hole into her Bowe, at which she receaved soe much
water that had not the sayd hole bin stopped by the helpe of her owne Carpenter
and the Carpenters mate of the Adventure and the company of the Adventure
and of the sayd Welches Childs and Goldings shipp who helped to pumpe her
and cleere her of water shee had without doubt sunck and foundered in the

danger to her for any of the sayd shipps to have wrought on through the Ice
to gaine shoare than to worke out again to sea by reason that when the sayd
shipps endeavoured to return back they who were neerest to shoare
were at least fowerteene leagues or rather more from shoare when
they

did by the Compasse observe that Bell Point did beare East South East of the Owners Adventure
of Bell point when shee was at the furthest place shee could get within the
Ice, and saith it was in the Judgment and apprehension of this deponent
and alsoe esteemed and declared by most of the Company of the sayd
shipp Adventure that it was a mervilous deliverance that the sayd shipp
should gett safe to sea against being soe farr engaged in the Ice And,

To the 10th hee saith that the sayd damerell having gott out of the Ice and
releeved the sayd Pybus his shipp in manner aforesayd some thick and
foggie weather happening at Sea the sayd damerell thereby lost the company
of the sayd fower shipps videlicet the sayd Pibus Welch Golding and Childe
roved up and downe at Sea after dutch shipps consorting with them upon
new designes following then to a place called hope island where the dutch
having killed about a hundred sea horses and taken their teethe leaving the
carcasses on shoare the damorell (sic) caused thirteene lande men hee
had on board and belonging to this shipp to be putt on shoare in the sayd Island
to blubber the Carcases of the sayd sea horses that is to take off their
skinnes and take the fatt of them and bring it aboard in boates to make
oyle of, and saith that the sea running high the when the sayd men were
putt on shoare and while other of the shipps company (sea men) passed to
and froe in boates to bring the sayd blubber or fatt aboard, they were
exceedeingly mett with the violence of the seas beating upon them and
for want of other refreshments many both of the said land and sea men
fell sick of the scurvie, and some of them dyed, and saith that while
the shipps company were soe by his sayd damerells order imployed
about fetching the sayd blubber the sayd damerell went aboard of the
fflemish shipp and there continued three or fower howers drinking
and this deponent coming in the meane tyme with a shallopp on board
the sayd fleming, heard the sayd damerell speaking to one Mr Covell (sic)
(who was imployed by the owners of the shipp the Owners Adventure
to looke after their affaires) say that the sayd fflemish shipp had a designe
to goe to the back side of Greeneland, and sayd hee the sayd damerell
did intende with his shipp the Adventure to keepe them company
thither, or to that effect, and this deponent telling the sayd damerell
that the sea runne soe high that his company could not well bring off any
more blubber then they had done, and that they should hardly bee able
to bring the land men (who were a shore cutting the blubber) from
off the Island on board, hee the sayd damerell answered and sayd that
hee hoped it would bee such a fogg that they, could not see to
finde their way to the shipp (meaning the Adventure) and then they must staye
to cutt and bring all the blubber or words to that effect all which notwith=

whales as hee hath heard some of the Companyes of the sayd

soe farr into a growne sea that all the boates who pursued her
were in danger to bee cast away which notwithstanding the arlate
Goslin held soe long and hard that the roape that hee held was

with the sayd Pybus his shipp and three other London shipps of which the arlate Welch
Golding and Child were Masters till about the fifteenth day of the moneth of June
aforesayd, on which day all the sayd shipps began to worke into the Ice togeather and
worked in togeather about seaven or eight leagues, and the ice then proveing soe
thick and that they could not then worke farther in, all the sayd shipps made fast to the
Ice the Owners Adventure the Greyhound and the arlate Welch and Goldings
shipps were all fastned togeather, and soe laye about sixteene howers, during
which tyme the sayd Pybus and Childs shipps by reason of the
thicknesse of the Ice not workeing in soe farr as the other shipps did, laye still
about a myles distance from them, and that upon the seaventeenth day
of the sayd Moneth the sayd damerell went on board the shipps of the sayd

I was told by the Merchants our Imployers when I was hyred, that you (meaning
the sayd Damerell) were to doe nothing of great concernement touching this voyage
without the advise of your mates and harponeeres, and therefore I pray consider what you
doe, for it is good to take neighbours fare, there no as able men in the other
shipps (meaning the sayd Welches Childs Pybus and Goldings shipps) as any
are in ours, and as desyrous to advance their voyage as wee, and they doe
not worke any further in why then should wee if wee leave our

with which words the sayd Gosling being provoked, thereupon
replyed and sayd thus or the like in effect wee will goe noe further except there were better hopes
of getting to harbour, and thereupon severall angrie words passing betwixt
the sayd Gosling and damerell which this deponent doth
not now remember, the sayd damerell at length called the sayd Gosling
pimpeing rogue, and gave him other opprobious language which not=

have the sayd shipp Owners Adventure wrought further into the Ice and
the shallopps being by the sayd shipps Company made ready to that purpose
while the words predeposed of happened betwixt the sayd damerell and Gosling,
the sayd Gosling and Maundry and all the rest of the sayd shipps
Company of which this deponent was one) did obey the Commands of the sayd

last at which tyme they left the company of the other fower shipps to the eighteenth thereof to worke the sayd shipp futher into the Ice
according to the sayd Damerells Commands, and in that tyme did worke her
about fower or five myles further into the Ice towards shoare than the other
fower shipps whose companyes they had left did goe, and did not the sayd
Gosling and Maundry did not (soe farr as hee this deponent could or did
see and observe) either by words or actions disobey the sayd damerells com=
mands after the words predeposed of spoken before they forsooke the Company
of the other fower shipps, nor encourage any others to doe soe, and the sayd shipp
being wrought 4 or 5 myles further into the Ice as aforesayd, the sayd shipp
was by the sayd damerells Command made fast to a peece of Ice, and after
shee had soe continued fastned about twelve or fowerteene howers there
others of the sayd shipp Owners Adventures Company then on the deck
sayd, that if the other fower shipps which they had left did endeavour to worke
in after him, then his shipp was soe much foreward as then theirs, and that
hee would then worke farther in toward shoare, but if the sayd other fower
shipps did worke out againe to Sea hee would doe the like, and did accordingly
order some of the sayd shipps Company (but who by name hee now remembreth

the shrowdes him selfe to take a view what the sayd other shipps did and how the Ice lay which was to shoare and having
viewed it and then, sayd thus or the like in effect, I see the other shipps (meaneing the
fower shipps aforesayd) are workeing out to sea, therefore lett us worke out alsoe
and thereupon the sayd shipps Company by the Command of the
sayd Damerell
did worke the sayd shipp Owners Adventure out of the Ice to sea to followe the
other fower shipps, And saith that nothing spoken or done by the saydd Gosling
or Maundry or either of them were any cause why the shipp Owners Adventure
gott not then or at any time after to Port, they allwaies acting and doeing
their part and dutie soe farr as this deponent could observe to have gained a Port (if it could have bin gained)
but the extreamity of Ice
was such that it afforded not any oportunitie to the shipp Owners Adventure
and her Company to gett to any harbour, And alsoe saith that the sayd shipp
being gott cleere out of the Ice to sea the sayd damerell did openly upon
the shipps deck before this deponent and divers others of the sayd shipps company
saye thus of the like in effect, I am glad the shipp is out (meaning the
Owners Adventure) and would not have her in againe (meaning
where she was when hee commanded her to be wrought ot to sea.)
for five hundred pounds: And further to those articles hee cannot depose

To the 9th hee saith hee knoweth the arlate Pybus Welch Child and Goulding
and saith they are all accompted able sea men, and men that have used
the Greeneland trade of fishing for many yeares, and accompted to bee well
experienced therein, And saith hee hath heard the sayd Pybus and Childe
since their returne to London from the voyage in question saye, that they
marvailed that the sayd damerell would worke his shipp soe farr into
the Ice as hee did, being there was (in their judgment) noe probability to
gett to harbour, And hee this deponent well knoweth that the sayd Pybus
his shipp by her goeing into the Ice at the same tyme and place (though not
soe farr as the Owners Adventure did) was soe much damnified and hurt
thereby and by breaking through the Ice againe to sea, that when shee was
gott cleere to Sea she was ready to sinke by reason of a hole the Ice
had staved in her bowe, at which shee tooke five or sixe feete water in
hold, and her company were ready to forsake her had not shee had
the helpe of the Companyes of the sayd Golding Welch and Child their
shipps, and of the Company of the Owners Adventure to helpe to
pumpe her and stopp her leake, And saith that at such tyme as the Owners
Adventure did begin to worke out of the Ice toward sea, Bell Point did
then beare East south East of the sayd shipp and was (in this deponents Judgment
about eight of tenn leagures distant from her, and hee this deponent did
observe that the Ice did beate and drive soe against the Rudder of the Owners Ad=

of gaineing harbour than when the sayd shipp began to worke out of the
Ice, and that the sayd Damerell did not attempte after such his workeing out,
to worke into the Ice againe at any place, but kept at Sea, but saith hee knoweth
not of any perswasion used by the sayd Maundry or Gosling or any of the
sayd shipps Company to the sayd damerell to endeavour for any harbour
after hee came out of thee Ice as aforesayd, And alsoe saith that hee knoweth
of noe difference which happened betwixt the sayd damerell and Gosling or
Maundry save the difference and ill language by him this deponent before
mentioned, which difference did (in this deponents Judgment) arise by the
sayd damerells wilfullnesse and rashnesse in desyring and Commanding
his shipps company to worke the sayd shipp further into the Ice than
other shipps would and did adventure, and by his provoaking the sayd
Gosling with ill language as aforesayd, And hee verily beleeveth that
nothing spoken or done by the sayd Gosling Maundrey or any
other of the sayd shipps Company was preiudiciall or any cause of
the overthrowe of the voyage arlate, but the same was lost by reason
there was noe probable oportunitie offered for the sayd shipp to gett into
harbour after shee came out of the Ice as aforesayd, (at least none
soe probable as that the sayd damerell lost at the sayd shipps first
coming within three or fower leagues of Bell Pointe) by his
not then putting into the Ice but goeing aboard his owne shipp Owners
Adventure till shee was come back to sea ward about tenn leagues
further from Bell Point) And further to this article hee cannot depose
for that the Owners Adventure and Greyhound looseing the Company
of the fower London shipps arlate at Sea in foggie and stormie weather
never proceeded their Company againe soe that hee knoweth not of his
owne knowledge, nor whether they did make voyage and kill whales in or neere harbour,

their retourne to London from the sayd voyage saye, that every of sayd
shipps after they soe lost the Company of the Owners Adventure and
Greyhound did gett into harbour and kill whales./

To the 12th hee saith hee hath knowne the arlate Maundrie and Gosling
only during the voyage in question, during which they did behave them=
selves like honest sober persons and like able seamen, and did worke
and faithfully discharge their duties the sayd voyage, although some difference
in words happened betwixt the sayd Damerell and Gosling in manner predeposed,
And further hee cannot depose, saveing hee saith hee hath heard that the
sayd Maundry and Gosling have used the Greeneland trade divers yeares
and borne office in severall shipps and behaved them selves well and
honestly in their places./

To the 13th hee saith that hee well knoweth that the arlate Maundrie and
Gosling and this deponent and others of the Company of the Owners Adven=
ture did pursue the whale in this article mentioned, eight or tenn howers
togeather, the sayd Gosling and one Richard Parker the Boatswaine of the
Owners Adventure and William humphrey having as harponeeres stricken the sayd whale
and fastned their warps, and the sayd whale notwithstanding ranne soe
fast into a growne Sea and towed the boates who pursued her soe
fast, that they were in danger to bee cast away by and to sheere under
water by the swiftenesse of the whales motion, which was soe speedy
that the shipp owners Adventure had much a doe with the helpe of a fresh
gale of winde to followe the shallopps or boates soe fast as the whale
towed or runne with them, And hee saith that after the sayd shipps
Company had soe longe persued the sayd whale
and the sayd Goslings harpeing
Iron breakeing out of the whale and the sayd Gosling having come
about along side and not being able to fasten his harpeing Iron againe did take holde of other shallops
and helpe them to hinder the whales motion, but all proveing ineffectual
to the takeing of her by reason of the growne Sea and the swiftnesse of the whale in question the sayd damerell
seeing noe hopes of takeing the sayd whale, did call to the sayd Richard
Parker and bidd him cut his warpe (which still continued fast to the whale) and come on board, And this deponent being one who
rowed in the sayd Maundeys shallop or boate
and helped to pursue the sayd whale, thereby well knoweth that the
sayd Gosling Maundry and the rest of the sayd shipps Company who
pursued the sayd whale did as much as possibly could bee done
to kill the sayd whale, and did not in any thing disobey the
Command of the sayd Damerell touching the pursuite and chase
of her soe farr as this deponent could and did observe, And further
saving his foregoeing deposition hee cannot depose/

And hee saith that the arlate Mr Beane did in the presence of the arlate Mr
Batson and in the sayd Batsons Counteing house tender unto this deponent a
paper which the sayd Batsons man brought ready written with the names of
severall of the Owners Adventures Company subscribed thereto, which
writeing did importe thus or the like in effect videlicet that the refusall of the sayd shipps Company
to obey the Commands of the sayd damerall was the cause of the Over=

this deponent to sett his hand to the sayd noate, and told him if hee
would subscribe the same they would doe more for him this deponent
than they had done for any other of the subscribers, but this deponent
having perused and read some part of the sayd paper and knowing the

And the sayd Gosling answering as aforesayd that hee was told upon hyred
the sayd damerell was to doe nothing of great concernement touching the voyage
without advice of his Mates and the harponeeres and desyring him therefore to

the sayd other shipps did whose masters and˺ companyes (hee beleeveth) were as desyred to

and spake to the sayd Gosling in an angrie manner and sayd I looke upon you but
as the Cabbin boy and a simple fellowe, with which words the sayd Gosling being
provoked replyed and sayd wee will goe noe further except there were better
hope of getting to harbour, and the sayd damerell being therewith much
displeased called the sayd Gosling pimpeing roague and other reproach=

damerell that if it pleased God hee did not make a good voyage hee the
sayd damerell might goe a pimpeing, or And to the rest of the sayd Interrogatorie
hee answereth negatively for that hee well knoweth that notwithstanding
the sayd words the sayd damerell still continueing his Command to worke
the sayd shipp further into the Ice the sayd Gosling and also the Interrogate
Maundrie did yeild obedience to the sayd damerells Command and did

the other fower English shipps aforesayd, did worke into the Ice toward
the harbour or shoare in Greeneland fower or five myles, and were then
about eight or tenn leagues from shoare in this deponents Judgment,
and hee verily beleeveth and is perswaded in his conscience that by reason
of the thicknesse of the Ice towards shoare it was farr more difficult and
hazardous to worke to shoare then to worke out the sea againe, neither
in deede was there in this deponents Judgment any hopes or possibility

To the 13th hee saith that hee knoweth that one reason
of the sayd damerells Keepeing company with fflemish shipps was
to have their Company to duckes Cove Interrogate, for that hee
imployed this deponent (being skilled in the dutch tongue) to speake to them

thither if they could, (by reason they could not gett into harbour in Greeneland)
but not dareing to goe in thither without leave of the English to whome the
fishing of that place belonged, to which place the Ice not affordeing a
convenient passage neither the sayd dutch nor the sayd damerell could attayne

endeavoured to worke into harbour rather then staye at Sea as they did
it being a thing which would have more conduced to the health of

better oportunities of getting to harbour then that shee had when shee

I was told by the Merchandes when I was hyred that you (meaning the

thereupon voluntarily sayd that if the other fower shipps (whose company

hee was now soe farr ahead of them, and that if they wrought out

June for divers dayes next following, and while they were soe in
Company they did againe attempte to put into the Ice toward harbour
and entered a little way in, but the weather proving on a suddaine
extraordinary thick and a hard gale of winde blowing, they were
all forced out to sea againe, and the weather still continuing
thick and the storme and winde encreaseing, the sayd damerell with
his shipps thereby lost the company of the other fower London shipps
and was driven to sea about 46 leagues from shoare, and never
recovered Company of the sayd English shipps during the voyage in
question And saith the sayd damerell having lost their Company
did afterwards associate and keepe company with two fflemish
shipps and this deponent heard him the sayd damerell hee being with him in the great Cabbin aboard of the sayd fflemings make consort=
shipp with the sayd fflemings to show them the way to Point Negro
being a point to the Eastward beyond ducks Cove where
hee supposed great store of fish to bee, which the sayd fflemings
did in the English tongue thanke him for, and gave him a cheese, and
the sayd damerell did accordingly goe to the Eastward with the sayd
fflemings but could not make any harbour there, there
being alsoe very great quantities of Ice, soe that the sayd damerell
not getting to harbour but keeping at sea some of his Company of the Owners Adventure for want of
refreshment on shoare fall sick of the Scurvie, And saith hee hath
heard severall of the Companyes of the sayd fower London shipps
since their returne from the voyage in question saye, that (after
they lost the Company of the Owners Adventure and Greyhound at
sea as aforesayd) they did about the thirteenth of July last gett
into harbour and kill whales and make a good voyage And
soe (as hee this deponent verily beleeveth and is perswaded in
his conscience) might the sayd damerell have done if hee
had not missed his oportunite of getting into harbour by
goeing Eastward with the fflemings, And hee saith that after the
17th day of June last there was not varianse betwixt
the sayd damerell and his Mates or any other of his Command, and her
Company touching the sayd voyage but they were all obedient to his Command, and hee
might and did goe with the sayd shipp whether hee pleased, and
this deponent beleeveth that nothing acted or sayd by the sayd Gosling or Maundry
was any lett or hinderanse for the voyage in question they
yeilding actuall obedience to his Commands notwithstanding
the differense and ill language aforesayd, but hee this deponent is
verily persuaded in his conscience that the losse of the voyage in
question was by the default of the sayd damerell in goeing
to the Eastward as aforesayd, and by his chaseing all fish that hee sawe
spowte, and thereby fo loosing his oportunities by often following
them farr from the edge of the Ice and not keeping neere the Ice
to see when an oportunitie offered to gett in towards shoare, And

hee having gone severall voyages with them thither before the voyage in

To the 13th hee saith that if the foresayd damerell
and Company of the Owners Adventure having espied the whales arlate
at sea the sayd damerell the shallopps belonging to the sayd shipp to bee
manned to chase her, and accordingly the harponeeres which were
Gosling, Maundrie, Humfreys, Parker, Bowling and Kirke did
every of them in severall shallopps with five men beside them
selves in every shallopp to assiste them (whereof this deponent was
one belonging to Maundries Shallopp) give chase to the sayd ˹whale˺ for
about an hower and a halfes tyme and seeing her soe swifte that
they could not come neere her, all the shallopps and their Companys
except the sayd Parkers) went aboard and gave over the chase, and the
sayd Parker staying behinde, the fish altering her course
came soe neere him that hee gott the oportunnitie to fasten to her
and having soe done made a waste to give notice that hee was
fast, whereupon the sayd Maundry Gosling and the rest of the harponeeres
and their Companyes (whereof as aforesayd this deponent was one) manned
their shallopps againe and the sayd Humfrey after about halfe an
houres chase or somewhat lesse gott soe neere as that hee alsoe
fastened to her and the rest of the harponeeres by reason of her swifte motion not
after shee felt her selfe pricked not being able to keepe
way with her were forced to laye hold on the sayd Humfreys
boate and make fast thereto untill any oportunitie would offer to
gett more Irons into her and soe hunge there to tyre her out, but
the whale still moved soe swiftly and towed them
up and downe about eight or tenn howers, and at length towed
them and their boates soe farr into a growne sea that most of the
boates were ready to be overwhelmed and their Companies
in of great danger of being drowned,
whereupon there being noe hopes of killing her, shee still
running soe swift that the shipp would hardly keepe way with her
boates Company and all the rest of the harponeeres and their
Companies (except the sayd Parker and humfreys and their Companies
who were fast to the whale) cast off their fasts which they
had made to Humfreys shallopp and came on board, and the
sayd humfrey and Parker continueing their hold and the
shipp comming somwhat neere the whale, the sayd Humfrey and
Parker called to Damerell and asked him whether they should
cutt loose, for it was impossible to kill her, whereto the sayd Damerell
sayd

sayd hee could not tell what they were best to doe, they might

Reynolds Chauntrie Ashmore Kirton and ffoard are land men and
have noe skill in the sea affayres to knowe when it is fitt to carry a shipp in
or out of harbour in such a voyage as Greenland is, which required a
great deale of judgement and experience and that their busines was only
to boyle and manage the ordering of the whales after they were kiled and
cut up and brought on shoare to them, And hee alsoe saith that the sayd
Batson and Beane did in the sayd Batsons house in London (since the voyage
in question ended) tender unto this deponent a writing importing an
acknowledgement that the sayd voyage was overthrowne by the Mates
and Mariners of the Owners Adventure disobeying the Commands of the sayd damerell, which this
and told this deponent that if hee would subscribe the same they would
bee more civill to him than any of the rest of the sayd shipps company,
expecting (as they sayd) that hee as well as Parker the Boatswaine (whose
name this deponent then sawe subscribed thereto) would rather ayde them the
sayd Batson and Beane therein (meaning in putting the default of the
losse of the sayd voyage upon the sayd mates and mariners) then otherwise:
whereto this deponent well knowing that the contents of the sayd writing
were utterly false replyed and sayd, hee know the contents thereof to bee
utterly false and that the sayd Batson and Beane had shipped him for that

eight or tenn leagues as did alsoe fower other English shipps which were
then in Company with the Owners Adventure and Greyhound,
and after the sayd shipps had all sixe of them wrought soe farr into
the Ice, the Ice then proving to bee somewhat thick this deponent
ordered his Companyes of his two vessells upon the fifteenth daye of June last which was the same day they began to XXX XXX to make fast to a
great Ice peece of Ice and lash their vessells fast board and board
to the shipps of Mr Golding and Mr Welch being two of the other fower
English shipps aforesayd, who had alsoe cause their Companys
to make fast their two shipps to the same peece of ice and the sayd
shipps being soe fastened, they all laye there for some tyme then
when the Ice would open as usually it doth, and this deponent
the next day (observing that the Ice did begin to open betweene
shoare and the sayd shipps ˹to the Eastward to the said shipps˺) did goe on boarde the shipps of the said
Welch and Goulding and aske them whether they would work
in their shipps any further with the Ice and told them hee did
discover that the Ice opened towards the shoare to the Eastward of the sayd shipps and therefore hee
thought they might well worke further into the Ice
and gett to
Bell sound or Greene harbour, or some other place neere shoare
and told them that hee this deponent was not confined to any
one particular harbour, whereto the sayd Goulding and Welch replyed
that they did desyre to see the whether the Ice would open more toward
Bell Sound ward, they being by order enioyned to goe thither
not to any other place if they could by any meanes possible make
thither, whereupon this deponent seeing that the sayd Goulding and
Welch were bound only for that particular place of Bell sound
and not willing for that reason to worke further into the Ice unless
it opened so oportunely as to pull them into that particular place, and
this deponent being desyrous in regard

went on board his owne shipp the Owners Adventure, and
commanded his boatswaine to call all the shipps Companye upon decke
and to gett their boates in a readinesse to worke the sayd shipps
the Owners Adventure and Greyhound further into the Ice towarde shoare,
Whereupon the arlate Gosling coming upon the deck did in a mutinous
manner saye thus or the like in effect wee (meaning him selfe
and the rest of the Company of the Owners Adventure) will goe noe
further, and speaking to this deponent sayd wee will see you hanged
before wee will goe any further with such a roague and a foole, and
sayd this deponent in tended to knock the sayd shipp on the
head, and this deponent thereto replying and telling the sayd Gosling
that better words could better become him and asking him how
hee could answere his refractory and disobedient carriage to th towards
Marchant this deponent and his commands to the Marchants imployers of the sayd
shipp, and telling him that if the voyage were overthrowne by this
his mutinous carriage and endeavoring publiquely to perswade and
inclyne the shipps Company to bee disobedient to him this deponent
in his commands touching the advance of the sayd voyage the losse
that would ensue thereon would bee greater then hee the sayd
Gosling or any of his relations were able to make good whereto the sayd
Gosling replyed and sayd that hee the sayd Gosling would answere what hee
did, to the Merchants, or to that effect and sayd hee this deponent if hee
made not a good voyage might goe a pimpeing when hee came home, and
gave this deponent other the like opprobrious language and showed him selfe
very backward and unwilling to proceede on any further to gett through
the ice to a harbour, and thereby much discouraged the rest of the Company
of the Owners adventure from performing their duties, which not withstanding
this deponent continuing still his resolution to worke further into the Ice
to gaine the shoare or some harbour, did commande and urge the sayd
shipps company to worke farther into the Ice toward shoare, and
they with much willingnesse did soe farr yeild obedience to this
deponents Command as that in about tenn howers tyme they did
worke the sayd too shipps Owners Adventure and Greyhound about seaven or eight
myles further into the Ice towards the shoare, and within about
five or sixe leagues of the shoare, And then hee saith this deponent
Commanding the saud shipp Owners Adventures company to worke
still on through the Ice to gaine the shoare the sayd Maundrye then speaking
openly upon the deck before the whole shipps company to this deponent sayd wee (meaning

you use your endeavoar to gaine a harbour or the shoare the sayd

never gett out againe, and therefore the devell take him that layes
his hands to helpe to worke in, but to worke out to sea againe
hee sayd hee and the Company were willing for that the rest of the shipps meaning
the sayd Goldings, Welches and Pybus and Childs shipps which went the
day before in this Company did not worke nor had wrought in soe
farr as they but were working out againe to Sea, and
therefore they would worke out alsoe and did actually refuse to worke in any further towards shoare whereupon the whole Company of
the sayd shipp being (as appeared by them) willinge to worke out to
Sea again than to worke further towards shoare and not helping
and assisting to worke towards the shoare though this deponent commanded them soe to doe this deponent was con=
streyned (by such the sayd Gosling and Maundrey their mutinous
perswasions and seduceing the Company from their obedience to
this deponents Commands of workeing in towards the shoare) to consent
and give Commande to worke the sayd shipps Owners Adventure and
Greyhound out of the Ice to Sea againe and loose his oportunitie of
gaineing the shoare, which hee is well assured and which verily beleeveth
and is perswaded in his conscience, might with some labour and
trouble have bin with safety gained and with as much safety as to worke out to sea againe if the sayd Gosling and Maundrey
had not soe discouraged and by their mutinous speeches perswaded the
sayd shipps Company to not to attempt the same, And if the sayd
shipps Company would have obeyed this deponents Commands and
wrought the sayd shipps to Shoare (as they might well have done)
this deponent is fully convinced in conscience and verily beleeveth
that the voyage in question would have proved very successful
and advantagious to the Merchant imployers of the sayd shipps
whereas by the meanes aforesayd the sayd voyage was almost [XXX GUTTER]
overthrowne, and proved very disadvantagious to the Imployers, there
being only two whales killed after the sayd shipps gott to sea againe
which for that they could not gett on shoare to boyle then they were
faine to being home in bloober togeather with the blubber of
about twenty butts of blubber of sea horses all which when it was
whales boyled at Blackwell after the returne home of the sayd shipps
from the sayd voyage accounted to eighteene Tonnes of oyle or
thereabouts And saith that after the sayd two shipps Owners Adventure
and Greyhound had worked them selves out of the Ice and were at sea
againe (beside the two whales killed as aforesayd) the arlate
humfreys and one Richard Parker Boatswaine of the Owners Adventure

there were twenty shallopps more shee had such a quick motion that
they could not kill her and therefore they would towe her noe more

them to lett her loose, soe the fault of letting her loose may bee
imputed to mee, goe you and helpe to kill her and the sayd Gosling and

the sayd Gosling and Maundrey and their boates crues came not againe to their
assistance the sayd humfrey first cut away his warpe, and
the sayd Parker after hee had strnghed a good while to hold her
(seeing the sayd Humfrey had alsoe forsaken him and cut his warpe
and left his hold of her) alsoe cut his warpe and soe lett the sayd
whale escape without killing, the premisses hee deposeth of his owne
sight and knowledge being Master
and on board while they were dine in manner aforesayd And
further cannot depose saving hee saith that by experience he knoweth
having used the ffishing trade to Greenelande for these 10 or 12 yeares last
past that those who goe thither to fish must passe through great quantities of
Ice and that when there is greatest quantitie of Ice there is usually most
whales in harbours and best advantage made of the ffishing trade and that
hee is well assured that there was noe more danger there of the Adventure
and Greyhound getting into shoare or into some harbour than this the voyage
in question than this deponent hath observed and knowne to bee in other yeares
wherein hee hath gone the sayd voyage./.

To the 8th and 9th hee saith that there were other shipps videlicet the sayd Pybus his
shipp and the sayd Welch his shipp and the sayd Goldings shipp and the sayd Childs
shipp in Company with the Owners Adventure and Greyhound when they first
put into the Ice and endeavoured to gett to some harbour or shoare which shipps
comming out of the Ice so doe as the Greyhound and Owners Adventure did,
did afterwards (as this deponent hath heard by the Masters of them) gott into
Greene harbour and Port Nick and fish there and make a very successfull
voyage And this deponent verily beleeveth and is perswaded in his conscience
that if the sayd Gosling and Maundrey and the rest of the Company of the Owners
Adventure would hve obeyed this deponents commands and wrought
further into the Ice when hee required them as aforesayd and when the sayd
shipps Owners Adventure and Greyhound were as aforesayd within about
five or sixe leagues of shoare which was on the seventeenth day of June 1656 they might very safely and well have gotten
into Greene harbour (being the place this deponent endeavoured to gett into)

The sayd damerell to the Interrogatories brought

To the first Interrogatorie hee saith that the voyage Interrogate was
overthrowne by the default of the sayd Edward Gosling and Richard
Maundrie and by their disobeying this respondents Commands and stirring
up others of the sayd shipp Owners Adventures Company to doe that
in manner as in his foregoing deposition hee hath at large declared
And saith hee doth not endeavour to cast any more blame touching the
overthrowe of the sayd voyage upon the sayd Maundrie and Gosling than what
hee well knoweth and is fully convinced in conscience they were and
are guilty of, and doth not feare in the least that the overthrowe of the
voyage and dammage thereupon ensuing can any way light upon him
this rendent, well knowing that hee this respondent did his best
endeavour to have made the sayd voyage successefull to the Imployers
of the sayd shipp, and therefore standeth not on neede any way to

To the 3 Interrogatorie hee saith that about the second of June last the shipp the Owners
Adventure lay about sixe or seaven leagues off Bell point, and the harbour did
then beare North East of the sayd shipp and saith the sayd Gosling and Maundry
nor any other of the sayd shipps Company did not then any waies move or
perswade this deponent to attempt there the putting into harbour, neither was there
any probability there of getting into harbour in the Judgment of this deponent and
of the Interrogate Mr Pibus, and Mr Welch two other Masters of shipps
who were as they sayd positively designed for Bell sound and desyrous to have gone thither if they could have
seene any probability thereof, and this deponent whilst the Owners Adventure
and the sayd Pybus and Welch their shipps laye there went on board the sayd Pybus
his shipp, as alsoe the sayd Welch did, and there they the sayd Pybus and Welch and
this respondent did consult togeather what was best to bee done and whether
there were any probability to get in there to Bell sound and upon such
their consultation the sayd Pybus and Welch and this deponent having Considered
maturely thereupon, did thinke it more convenient to put to sea againe
and plye more to the Southwards of the Ice, expecting there to meete
better opportunitie of gaining shoare, and thereupon the sayd Pybus his
shipp put out to sea and this deponent and the sayd Welch continued aboard
her haveing each of them a shallopp fastned to her, and the sayd Welches shipp
and the Owners Adventure, and Greyhound seeing the sayd Pybus his shipp
make out to sea, did sayle out with her and after the sayd Pybus his
shipp had sayled about sixe or eight leagues hee this deponent
tooke his shallopp and went aboard his shipp the Owners Adventure, and the sayd
Welch then alsoe tooke his shallopp and went aboard his shipp, And hee
doth by virtue of his oath declare that upon the seaventeenth day of June
last when the sayd Maundrey and Gosling did in manner predeposed
resiste this deponents commands and by their mutinous carriage and speech
discourage the rest of the Company of the Owners Adventure from
workeing further into the Ice as this deponent commanded, the sayd shipp
was then as neere Bell Point
(it then bearing East and by south of the sayd shipp) as when this deponent
went on board the sayd Pybus his shipp as aforesayd when Bell Point
boare North East as aforesayd, and saith the sayd Gosling and Maundris muti=
nous carriage and speeches were the cause why the Company of the sayd shipp
were soe discouraged that they did not worke the sayd shipp further in to
shoare as this deponent commanded, which if they had done this deponent
verily beleeveth and is perswaded in his conscience that they might then with
lesse difficulty and danger either have gained Bell Sound, (or Greene
harbour which had bin as good a place) as they could have gained Bell sound
at such tyme as this deponent went aboard the sayd Pibus shipp when Bell
Point boare North East as aforesayd; And further hee cannot answere/

To the 4th hee saith there was a writing or order in writing given by the
sayd Batson and others Imployers of the Owners Adventure to this deponent
whereby they left the whole mannagement of the voyage in question to
this deponent and to his Judgment, but withall orders this deponent (soe often
as hee thought fitt) to advise with the sayd Gosling and Maundry and the harponeeres

or to that effect, of which order hee this deponent hath a coppy and
beleeveth the originall order is in the hands of the sayd Master, And saith
hee this deponent did severall tymes advise with the sayd Gosling -
Maundrie and the harpooners during the sayd voyage but found them
alwaies unwilling to make for a harbour but desyrous rather to keepe
at sea And further cannot answere/

To the 5th Interrogatorie hee saith after hee came from on board the sayd Pybus his
shipp as aforesayd, hee did keepe company with the shippe of the sayd Pybus
and Welch and of Mr Golding and Mr Child, all belonging to London, and
together with them did upon the fifteenth day of June begin to worke
into the Ice and they all wrought in together about eight or tenn
leagues which they did in about tenn or twelve howres tyme, and
and the same day they all made fast to the Ice, videlicet the sayd Goulding and
Welch and this dependent made fast their shipps to one peece of Ice and
alsoe lashed fast one of an other and soe laye till about the sixteenth
day at Noone, when this deponent having bin aboard the sayd Golding
and Welch and had conference with them to the effect in his foregoing
deposition declared, hee came againe on board his own shipp the Owners
Adventure and gave command as before is deposed to worke her
further into the Ice and to the rest of this Interrogratorie he answereth negatively
saving his foregoing deposition./

To the 6th and 7th and 8th Interrogatories hee saith that upon such his
giving Command on the sixteenth day of June last to worke the sayd
Shipp Owners Adventure further into the Ice towards shoare, the sayd
Gosling coming upon the deck, did as is predeposed in a mutinous
manner saye to this deponent whether will you goe, will you knock
the shipp on the head, (speakeing in this
behalfe of himselfe and the rest of the sayd shipps Company) will
goe noe further, and this deponent seeing the sayd Gosling by
his mutinous speeches endeavour to distracte the sayd Company
from goeing any further into the Ice and thereby endeavour the
frustrating of the voyage, did replye and say to the sayd Gosling
what is that to you, I looke not upon you as one to bee made
acquainted, follow you your business and doe as you are commanded
whereto the sayd Gosling replyed that hee scorned to bee commanded
by such a knave and rogue and foole as this deponent, and other
the like opprobrious and mutinous terms and speeches and sayd hee
was told by the Merchants Imployers of the said shipp that hee this
deponent was not to acte anything of Concernement in the
sayd voyage without the advice and consent of the Interrogate Gosling
and Maundrey his Mates and the harpooners whereto this deponent
replyed I care not what order you have by words of mouth I have
an order in writing that I should aske according to my discernment
for the best advantage of the voyage, which you by this your behaviour
goe about to overthrowe and how you will answere this your carriage to
the Merchants I knowe not, whereto Gosling replyed and sayd hee
would answere it well enough, and gave other the like mutinous
and badd language whereby the company were much distracted
but this deponent still continueing his Command to worke the
sayd shipp further into the Ice toward shoare the sayd Gosling and
Maundry

HCA 13/71 f.483r Annotate
Maundry and the rest of the sayd shipps company did (with
much unwillingnesse) worke the sayd shipp about seven or eight
myles further into the Ice than the other fewer shipps did worke, and
within about five or six leagues of the shoare, and this deponent
commanding them still to worke on towards shoare, the sayd
Maundrie then spake to this deponent upon the deck before the company
of the sayd shipp and sayd wee will go noe farther, whether would
you have us to goe I will bee hanged if any shipp sail into here any
harbour in Greeneland this yeare, or if they did they will never
gett out and the devell take him that layes his helpeing hand
to worke in, but to worke out to Sea againe wee are willing,
and this deponent observing and seeing that the shipps company
were by the sayd Gosling and Maundries speeches distracted from
workeing further in and were unwilling to work further in, hee this
deponent commanded the company that if they would
not worke her further in they should not lett her drive, but make
her fast to the Ice, which they did, and soe the sayd shipp continued
there fast to the Ice till the seventeenth day of the sayd month of June
and then this deponent commanded them againe to worke further in
towards shoare and the sayd Maundrey replyed the in behalfe of
him selfe and the sayd shipps company and sayd thus or the like, in effect
if the other shipps (meaning the sayd Pybus Welch Golding and
Childs shipps whose company they had left on the sixteenth day
of the sayd month) did worke in then they would worke further in,
but if these shipps wrought out to sea they would worke out alsoe,
whereto this deponent answered and sayd this or the like in effect
what have I to do to bee regulated by other shipps actions, they
are designed for Bell Sound and noe other place, but I am at
liberty to goe to any harbour where I can gett in and if I cannot
gett Bell Sound yet I doubt not but to gett into Greene Habour
but since I see you are resolved only to act as you see other shipps
doe, turne the shipp about and worke back to them, which they did,
and this deponent being gott to sea in company of the said fewer
shipps hee this deponent did saye thus or in the like effect that in regard his Company
would not bee ruled by him to worke in, as hee commanded them,
hee was glad hee had recovered the company of those shipps againe,
that hee might bee in a possibility in their company to do some=
thing which might advance the sayd voyage, since hee sawe his sayd
shipps company would doe nothing when they were alone, and out
of their company, And further saving his foregoing deposition hee
cannot answere otherwise than negatively./

To the nynth hee saith hee well knoweth that the sayd Pybus Welch
Childe and Golding are able seamen and well experienced in the
Greeneland ffishing and well understand that imployment, And to thee

not beleeving it to be true for that hee heard the sayd Gosling since his returne from
the voyage in question saye that if hee had not bin designed

as this deponent did and that if hee had bin soe farr in as this
deponent was, hee would not have doubted to (if hee could not
than gott into Bell Sound) to have gott into Greene harbour for
that (as hee sayd) the very Current or indraught would have
carried a shipp into Greene habour./

To the 10th hee saith that after this deponent with the Owners Ad=
venture and Greyhound was gott to sea againe and in Company
of the aforesayd fowrer London shipps, hee was parted from their
company by the extraordinary foggie weather, and stresse of
winde, and after hee had lost their company and the stormie weather
was over, this deponent came in with the land to southward of
Bell Point and to the edge of the Ice, and caused his Company
to worke to worke her in about three or foure myles, and having
soe done the ice beginning to prove thick this deponent went up in
the shrowdesto the top mast head to discover what probability hee
could see of getting to harbour and came downe againe and the sayd Maundrie and Gosling
came up of afterwards went up to take view alsoe and called to this
deponent to come up againe and told this deponent that the Ice was
soe thick that it was impossible to gett into harbour and that
that stormie weather had noe whit removed it but that it laye
like a wall towards shoare and that they would bee hanged if any
shipps did gett into Greeneland that yeare and these premisses were
soe spoken and done about the tenth day of July 1656 whereupon this
deponent seeing their unwillingnesse to worke to harbour and
with all seeing the Ice thick towards shoare no likelyhood to
gett in, did put out to sea againe, and the killed a whale
at sea on the backside of the Ice and afterwards videlicet about the
eighteenth or 19th of the sayd month of July 1656 this deponent
seeing noe hopes to get into any harbour to the Southward or North
ward, did goe about Point Lookeout, and sayled Eastwards
hopeing to gaine ducks Cove, which hee knew at that tyme of the yeare used
to bee a good harbour for fishing if hee could gett in, but found
it soe full of Ice that hee could not gett in there neither, in which

suffered not any hard shipp by this deponents mennes endeavouring

to harbour and lost this oportunity of getting to harbour by their
disobeying this deponents commands the tyme predeposed of, and could
never afterward meete with the like oportunitie of getting to harbour during
the whole voyage, and saith hee hath heard that the other foure
shipps after they were by storme and foggie weather parted from

made a good voyage, the sayd and saith the disobedience of

the sayd shipp Owners Adventure lost oportunitie aforesayd of getting

Coast of Greeneland they there happened into the company of four
other English shipps belonging to London and whereof Mr Pibus Mr Child
Mr Golding and Mr Welch were Masters of the Owners Adventure and
Greyhound and the sayd fower shipps did in the sayd month of June
worke all into the Ice together, and having wrought in divers
myles, the Owners Adventure and Greyhound and the sayd Goldings and
Welch his shipps made fast to the Ice and alsoe lashed or fastned
one aboard of another, and after they had layen for some howers
the sayd damerell came from on board the sayd Gouldings
shipp and gave Command to the Company of the Owners Adventure
and Greyhound to endeavour the working the sayd vessells further into
the Ice toward shoare in order to gett them to some harbour which
hee knew were the likeliest place to gett good fishing and to make ready their boates or shallopps to that
purpose which
Command hee gave publiquely upon the deck and the sayd Gosling
Maundrie and others of the sayd shipp company and this deponent did well heare
such his Command, and thereupon the sayd Gosling and Maundrey being
as appeared unwilling to worke further into the Ice towards harbour
sayd this or to this effect, that there was noe getting into harbour
that yeare, that noe shipps would gett into harbour that yeare and if
they did gett in they would never gett out againe and that they would
be hanged if any shipp gott into harbour, whereto the master
replyed to this effect wee shall never knowe whether wee can gett in

continueing his Command to have the sayd shipp wrought further into
the Ice towards shoare the sayd Gosling Maundry and the rest of the
Company of the Owners Adventure did launch out their boates and worke
four or five myles or better further towards shoare then the other four shipps
did and then by command of the sayd Damerell fastened to the Ice againe and lay still severall houres
and then the Master comanding againe to worke her still further
into the Ice towards shoare one Mr Orvell (sic) who was by the Owners
of the Owners Adventure imployed to bee Overseer or husband
of her in their behalfe did goe up into
the mayne topp, and foretopp to see and disover how the Ice lay and
what possiblity there was of getting to harbour, and came downe and
declared openly upon the deck before this deponent and divers others the sayd shipps company that hee
did discover that there were glaces or openings in the Ice toward
shoare, and that hee did discover a cleerer sea beyond
the Ice towards shoare and therefore did verily beleeve that if the Company
would strive and endeavour soe to doe they might gett in to shoare
and thereupon the sayd Master renewed his Command, and commanded
the sayd Maundry Gosling and the rest of the Company of the owners
Adventure to manne their shallopps and endeavour the working of
the sayd shipp to shoare and some of the Company of the sayd shipp
thereupon began to make ready the shallopps in order to obey the
Masters command but the sayd Maundrie standing upon the
fforecastle of the Owners Adventure and speaking to the sayd damerell sayd publiquily in the presence
and hearing of this deponent and diverse others of the sayd shipps
Company thus or the like in effect, By God, for my part I will not
laye a hand to a roape to worke in and the divell take him for my
part that layes a hand to a roape to worke in, I would I were
on board of my brothers shipp (meaning the shipp whereof his
brother John Manudrie was Master and which was then alsoe upon the coast of Greeneland
upon a fishing designe) and or upon aboard of one of the fflemish
shipps (meaning fflemish shipps then alsoe upon the sayd Coast) and
then lett my wages be hanged I care not what becomes of that, by
which words and the other words before spoken by the sayd Gosling and Maundry
the sayd shipps Company were soe discouraged that they had noe mynde to worke
any further in toward shoare (nor did worke in any further toward shoare whereupon the sayd damerell sayd well I see
because you have not your brothers company and the Company of the
other shipps you have noe mynde to worke in and to make a voyage without
them, though I see or knowe noe reason why wee being two shipps (meaning
alsoe the Greyhound) may not worke in without them and make a good voyage
but since you will not obey my Commands, and worke in lett the losse of
the dammage light upon you (meaning the sayd Gosling and Maundrie) or the sayd
damerell spake words to that effect, and soone after the sayd shipp Owners Adventures
Company began to worke out of the Ice againe to sea but by whose order hee knoweth

the sayd Maundrie Gosling and William humfreys and Richard Parker and
Mathew Bowlding all harponeeres went out in severall shallopps to chase
and kill the sayd whale, and chased her for the space of sixe or eight howers
but this deponent continueing a board the Owners Adventure and not
goeing in any of the sayd shallopps to assiste the harponeeres as others
of the sayd shipps Company did (every harponeere haveing to assiste him
in his shallop fower rowers and a steeres man) cannot of his owne certaine
knowledge relate every of the particular passages touching the chaseing the sayd
whale, but did from on board observe that they chased her a long tyme and
that her motion was very swifte, in soe much that the sayd shipp could not
keepe way with her, and that shee being struck by the sayd Parker who
fastned his warpe to her did towe both him and the sayd Maundries and
Gostlings shallops soe fast (they having made fast their boates one to
another to clogge and tyre her with) that at length the sayd Gostling (sic) and
Maundrey and all the other shallops except the sayd Parker who contiinued
fast to her Cast off their fasts which they had fastned to Parkers shallopp
and left further pursueing the sayd whale and came aboard the Owners Ad=
venture, and the Master askeing them why they gave over the pursuite
seeing Parker continued fast to the whale, they the sayd Gosling, Maundrie
and humphreys sayd that shee moved soe swifte that they could not keepe upp
with her nor gett up with her neither to launce her nor or fasten more Irons in her, and thus GUTTER
gave over the chase, and saith that not longe after the sayd Parker seeing none GUTTER
of the other shallopps returne to his assistance, cut his warpe and lett the
whale goe and came alsoe on board And further cannot depose/

To the 7th hee saith that when the sayd Gosling and Maundrie did in manner
predeposed disobey the Commands of the sayd damerell in workeing the sayd
shipp Owners Adventure further in towards shoare, and by such their speeches discourage
the rest of the sayd shipps Company from doeing the same, the sayd shipp
was in this deponents Judgment within sixe or seaven leagues of shoare
and soe farr as this deponent could discover, and as hee verily beleeveth
might as safely have gotten to shoare as made her way back to Sea
And saith hee hath used the Greeneland ffishing many yeares, and hath
made eleaven or twelve severall voyages thither as a Cooper, and
hath thereby observed that some yeares the shipp hee hath gone in hath layn
fast in Ice three weekes togeather, and farther from shoare by much than
the Owners Adventure and Greyhound were the tyme arelate when they putt back againe to Sea
and yet have gained an oportunitie to make to shoare and have gott to shoare
and made a good voyage, and some voyages thither this deponent hath made

To the 10th hee saith hee being Cooper as aforesayd of the Owners Adventure
knoweth that the Owners Adventure brought home all the finne and blubber which
was gained both by her and the Greyhound the voyage in question, and saith
that the sayd blubber being boyled after it came into the River of Thames
neere Blackwell, there was eighteene tonne and a halfe of oyle made of the
sayd Blubber which hee in his Judgment and estimate valueth

hee knoweth not of any oportunitie which was offered to gett into harbour
after the Owners Adventure came out of the Ice to Sea as aforesayd, and
saith what hardship and extremity the company of the Owners Adventure suffered, was
by reason they could not gett to harbour, and for want of
fresh victualls and other refreshments which they might have had on shoare if
they could have gotten to a harbour, and not by the sayd damerells goeing
on board the sayd dutch shipp or by any default of the sayd

the sayd damerell had nothing to doe with it, and that if it belonged to any body it
belonged to the Merchants (meaning the Imployers of the sayd shipp) and that it
was as sufficiente to give it to them as the sayd damerell, [whereupon]

that if hee the sayd Goséing were this crosse (and hindered the voyage by his crossnesse

but the master still continueing his Command to worke the sayd shipps
Owners Adventure and Greyhound further in, the Companyes of them though
they were very much discouraged by the sayd Goslings speeches, did worke the

wee will worke noe further in, and I dare venture my life to a farthing

Gosling and Manndry) for I know not what to doe, I am over powered by [XXX GUTTER]

did follow them, or make towards seawards, and told the sayd damerell the
other shipps were workeing out of the Ice to seawards whereupon the sayd damerell
went up himselfe into the maine topp and when he came downe sayd, I [see they GUTTER]
are workeing out, therefore turne the shipps and work out alsoe or
words to that effect, And saith that the sayd shipps by reason of the sayd
Gosling and Maundries their unwillingnesse (both at the tymes before [XXXX GUTTER]
and after during the whole voyage) to worke into the Ice towards the shoare, and
their discouraging of the Company with their speeches, did not gett into
harbour that voyage by which meanes the sayd shipps Owners Adventure
and Greyhound returned home with only a smale quantitie of bloober
oyle, and ffinne and the voyage was thereby exceedingly preiudiced
And further to these articles hee cannot depose.

To the 6th he saith that after the sayd two shipps Owners Adventure
and Greyhound had wrought themselves out to sea againe their Company
espied a whale (being as hee beleeveth the whale in this article mentioned
and the sayd Gosling humfreys Manndry and Parker and other harponeeres
and every of their boates crues (which are five a peece beside the harponeere) did
chase the sayd Whale, and the Owners Adventure and Greyhound sayled up and downe after
the boates as in such cases is accustomed, and saith the sayd Parker did fasten
to the whale, and soe alsoe did the sayd humphreys, and the rest of the
harponeeres not having oportunitie to fasten to her by reason of her swifte
motion, did fasten their boates to the boate of the sayd humfreys to [hinder GUTTER]
motion and tyre her with towing them and saith that they continued the
chase of the sayd whale eight or tenn howres and more, but saith that in [this GUTTER]
tyme the said Maundrie did cast off or lett loose, three of the boates
that were in chase and not fast to the whale twice or [thrice GUTTER]
by which meanes he did very much hinder them in the tyreing out
the whale with their weight, they being faine to rowe up and downe two or
three leagues before they could come neare to fasten their boates on to
other as they were before, and saith that the sayd Maundrie and Gosling
(after they had chased the sayd whale about [XX GUTTER]
howers came aboard the Owners Adventure with their boates, and sayd
that the whale was not to be killed her motion was soe swift and the
winde then blowing fresh, which notwithstanding the master commanded
there in regards humfreys and Parker continued still fast to goe off in
their boates againe and helpe them to kill the whale, and sayd the sayd Gosling
and Maundrie answered and sayd shee was a divell and noe whale, and
they could not kill her, and that they would goe off noe more or words to that
effect: whereupon the sayd humfrey without any order from the Master
cut loose from the whale and came aboard the Owners Adventure hee and his
boats Crue, and the said Master seeing that all but the sayd Parker and
his Crue had given over the chase of the sayd whale caused the shipp to
bee steered towards the whale, and the whale comming neere the shipp and
the sayd Parker still being fast to her hee the sayd Parker asked the Master what
[XXXX GUTTER]
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.492r Annotate
should doe whether he should cutt her loose or not and the sayd Master then commanding the sayd Gosling
Parker Maundrie humfreys and the rest of the harponeeres who had given
over the chase to manne their boates and goe to the assistance of the sayd Parker
they all stood still and did not goe, whereupon the Master sayd, I see there
is noe body will assiste, therefore doe what you will, and then the sayd Parker
alsoe cut loose and came aboard with his Crew alsoe, this hee deposeth of his
owne sight and knowledge being aboard the Owners Adventure during the
chase and seeing and hearing the premisses And saith hee believeth if the
sayd Gosling Maundrie and humfreys had not left off the chase of the
whale in manner aforesayd they might have killed her, and saith hee
the rather beleeveth it, for that hee heard the sayd humfreys in the Cooke
Roome of the Owners Adventure after his coming on board sayd in presence
of this deponent and his precontest Thomas Chauntrell and others that
after the sayd Maundrie and Gosling had with their boates given over the
chase, hee hawled up his boate and gave the whale a prick or two in
the tayle to make her carrie the faster that he might cutt her away
And further hee cannot depose./

To the 7th he saith that at such time as the sayd Maundrie spake
the words predeposed and thereby discouraged the shipps Company from
workeing further in toward shoare, the sayd shipps Owners Adventure
and Greyhound were in this deponents judgement about five or six leagues
off of Bell Point, And hee verily beleeveth that sayd shipps might
have gotten to shoare, being gotten soe neere, if they would have stayed
to watch an oportunitie of the opening of the Ice (as some tymes it

And saith the Company of the Owners Adventure and Greyhound
by reason they kept at sea and did not gett to harbour suffer much
hardshipp, and some of them fell sick of the scurvie for want
of refreshment on shoare, but saith the same was not (in his

To the first and second articles of the sayd allegation hee saith and
deposeth that the articulate William Lee with the shipp the Samuell and the
articulate William Otter with the shipp the Providence came in Company
together upon the fifth day of September 1656 from Newcastle and being
to the Northwards of Scarborough Castle, and the winde being then contrary
at south, upon the sixth of the sayd moneth the Samuell stood off, and the
Providence stood in, and soe came neere one the other, whereupon the
sayd Otter or some of his Company both called out, and alsoe waved
to the Company of the Samuell to beare up, whereupon
the sayd Lee in order to doe as the sayd Otter desyred and to avoide
all danger which afterwards ensued, did accordingly cause John
deane the Carpenter who was then at the helme of the Samuell to beare
up the helme, and cause his Company of the Samuell to brace the mayne
sayle and mayne topsayle in the winde, and brayle up the mizen and
used all meanes possible to goe to the Lee ward of the Providence
and to gett cleere of her and to prevent any doeing any
dammage to, or receaveing any dammage from the sayd Otters shipp,
But the sayd Otter notwithstanding hee or his companie had both called to and waved
to the Company of the Samuell as aforesayd, did not use any meanes
either by putting his shipp Providence on the stayes or otherwise from
to prevente her comming fowle of the Samuell but being to
the weather of the Samuell, came with full sayle and [?rane]
stemmelings aboard her, and with the force thereof brake downe the
Samuells heads, and carried away about twenty foote of her stearne
and brake downe her forecastle and three beames of her upper deck,
and carried away a peece of planke of about two foote longe under
her fore channell, and soe dammnified the Samuell that this deponent
and others of her Company by reason of her leakinesse occasioned
by the meanes aforesayd, did verily thinke that shee would presently
have foundered in the sea and bin lost both shee and her ladeing
of Coales and that all her Company could alsoe have perished
thereby, and one who was a passenger aboard the Samuell seeing
the danger shee was in and being doubtfull to perish in her, gott out of
her aboard the Providence, and this deponent seeing the danger the
Samuell was in, did call out to the Company of the Providence and
desyre them to staye till the Samuells Company could gett their boats
out to gett aboard the Providence, but the Providence her Master and
Company tooke noe care for preserveing any of the Samuells Company

them to the mercie of the sea, and the sayd Passenger comming afterwards

told this deponent that hee heard the Company of the Providence
saye that for halfe an howers tyme after the sayd
disaster happened they looked continually when they should
see the Samuell sinke, And saith that the Samuell by the meanes
aforesayd was very much damnified but to what value hee
cannot depose for that her ladeing of Coales is not yet out of her
and a view not taken of her hurt receaved, And further to thes articles
hee cannot depose/

To the 3 article hee saith that hee observed that after the dammage
done as aforesayd the sayd shipp Providence did make towards Whitby
which was about five leagues further off than Scarborough was, [?when GUTTER]
as shee might with more ease and safety have gained Scarborough
and might have gotten to Scarborough twoe or three howers before
the Samuell came thither, And saith hee heard the sayd passenger
after hee came on board the Samuell againe as aforesayd, saye
that the Company of the Providence lookeing still when the Samuell
would sinke, did in the meane tyme neglect to [?trye] their owne
pumpe, but afterwards [try]eing the same, found that shee had alsoe
receaved some harme by the meanes aforesayd, and thereupon, night
draweing in, the Providence and her Company came a shoare in
a place called Robin hoods bay (being a place about the midd
way betwixt Scarborough and Whitby) and there bilged her upon a
Rock and thereby much preiudiced her, for hee heard the sayd
passenger and alsoe a Carpenter who went from Scarborough
to [?buy] the Providence after she was bilged, saye, that if shee
had not bilged upon the Rock shee had not receaved the worth
of five shillings dammage in her hull And further to this

To the 4th and 5th hee saith that while the Samuell remayned at
Scarborough hee this deponent sawe the sayles masts
yards Anchors and Cables and boate of the Providence

that the sayd Otter sold the hull of the sayd shipp for fifteene
pounds five shillings sterling, and that the sayd Otter, was
offered twelve pence a horse load for all her ladeing
of Coales but refused to take it saying that hee would
have for them according as the markett price was at
Whitby And saith that for the reasons before declared
hee is verily perswaded in his conscience that had the sayd
Otter carried his sayd shipp and ladeing into Scarborough
as hee might easily have done, and as the sayd Lee did the
Samuell, hee might have saved his sayd shipp Providence and
ladeing with very smale losse And what losse happened to

To the first article hee saith this deponent hath well knowne the articulate

Master of her that voyage, And saith that of his this deponents sight and
knowledge the Port of Porto Port in Portugall is a barrd Port, and by
reason of the barr and alsoe by reason a great fresh doth usually runne
downe the Port and the Port is very narrowe and rockie on the one side

lay soe neere shoare as hee durst for feare of danger (the winde
blowing stronger to shoare and against tyde) and having expected a pylott
and none comeing from shoare by reason the winde was contrary for them
to come out, and flood being spent, and it being like to prove most
stormie and tempesteous weather, the sayd Jeggles to prevent danger of her,
his sayd shipp being driven ashoare and for the better security of her,
her ladeing and her companyes lives, did stand off to sea, and that
night the weather proved very stormy and tempestious and the winde
encreased and blew very stronge to shoare, soe that this deponent in his
Judgement is verily persuaded that had not the sayd Jeggles stood off
to sea as he did, but continued all night before Porto Port the sayd
shipp and her ladeing and Company had bin in eminent danger of
being drive ashoare and perishing in the sea this hee deposeth upon

from England to Barbados and from Barbados to England hee
well knoweth that it is at least fifteene hundred leagues betwixt

did not goe thence for Barbadoes till the Anne went thence and

Elias Watson of the parish of Saint Mary Woollchurch
London Merchant aged 25 yeares or thereabouts a
wittnesse sworne and examined saith and deposeth as
followeth videlicet./

To the 3 article of the say allegation and the Schedule therein mentioned hee saith that in the yeare one
thousand sixe hundred fifty fower and moneths therein concurring hee
this deponent was a factor and Correspondent to the arlate James
Cowse at the Island of Palma one of the Canarie Islands and there
by letters of Correspondence and Invoices received from the sayd
Cowse as alsoe by a bill of ladeing signed (as hee beleveeth by
the arlate Edward Keene) and alsoe by letters to the same effect sent
to this deponent by his this deponents father Mr Elias Watson of
London Grocer, hee well knoweth that the sayd Cowes did cause the
goods schedulate to bee laden aboard the arlate shipp the
John and Elizabeth at or neere London to bee transported to Santa Cruze
in the Island of Palma aforesayd for the use and Account of him the sayd
Cowse, And further saith that hee this deponent by letters sent from
Saint Lucar by Mr Edward Watts and Mr Peter Probie English Merchants
there to this deponent at Palma was informed that the same
Keene did arrive with the goods Schedulate at Saint Lucar and hee
there unladed and delivered them to the sayd Watts and Probie And further to this
article hee cannot depose/

To the 7th article of the sayd allegation hee saith that hee this
deponent being a factor resident at Palma the tyme aforesayd
and having lived as a factor in the sayd Island upwards of
sixe yeares and in that tyme sold severall parcells of the
like goods as are Schedulate, thereby knoweth that the goods Schedulate
if they had safely arrived at Palma in the yeare 1654 as they
ought to have done, would there have then yeelded the prices Schedulate
or very neere thereabouts, videlicet in his this deponents Judgement
they would have then yeelded there fiftie thousand Ryalls all
which is one thousand two hundred and fiftie pounds sterling,
hee this deponent hath severall tymes in the tyme of his residense
at Palma there, sold the like quantitie of such goods as are
Schedulate at the respective rates Schedulate, and sometymes
more, And saith hee by reason of his long residense at Palma
experimentally knoweth that the Custome Commission and other
charges of the like goods as are Schedulate
there sold, doe usually, and did at the tyme arlate amount to ten
per Cent videlicet the Royall Custome to sixe pounds sterling per Cent, Commission and
factorage to three pounds per Cent of like money, and warehouse
and other pettie charges to one pound per Cent of like money, And saith hee
also knoweth by letters of Correspondence thence that the like goods
as are Schedulate, doe usually at Saint Lucar yeild a farr lesse rate then they
doe in Palma whether the goods in question designed to goe, and
therefore
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.508r Annotate
therefore is fully convinced in conscience that the sayd Cowse
by the sayd Keene his delivery of the sayd goods Schedulate at Saint
Lucar and not bringing them to Palma (according as by bill of
ladeing it appeared to this deponent hee was bound to doe) hath suffered
great losse and dammage especially in the Aurellas
Cheynies and ffloramides Schedulate being (in all forty peeces of Norwich
stuffs) which by reason they could not bee sold at Saint Lucars were
afterwards transported for Palma, and the sayd Cowse his Agents
being forced to pay three, (if not fower) severall Customes for the
sayd stuffes, beside severall other charges, (this deponent him selfe
paying one of the sayd Customes in the Island of Palma and Mr
John Lasby an other of Cowse his Correspondents an other Customes
for the sayd stuffs in the Island of Teneriff, beside the customes paid
at Saint Lucar for them) and hee knoweth that the sayd Cowse by the sayd
stuffes being landed at Saint Lucar and afterwards of necessitie being transported
to Palma did suffer other losse and dammage alsoe for that after this
deponent had sold a part of them at Palma hee this deponent by
reason of the Imbargo upon Englishmens estates occasioned by
the warrs betwixt England and Spaine (which broke out before hee this
deponent could dispose of the sayd stuffes) could never recover any thing
for them of those hee had sold them to, soe that the
sayd Cowse was of this deponents knowledge damnified in the
sale of the sayd stuffes only, at the least fifty pounds sterling by
the meanes aforesayd but what his further dammage was hee
this deponent cannot estimate And further to this article hee
cannot depose./

To the 8th article hee saith that this deponent being the tyme arlate the
Correspondent of the sayd James Cowse at Santa Cruse and
having also in the behalfe of his this deponents father Elias Watson a third part of the Tonnage taken by the sayd Cowse in the shipp
the John and Elizabeth aforesayd (where of the sayd Keene was Master) for

deponent that hee the sayd Cowse had taken tonnage for threescore tonnes
in the sayd shipp, videlicet forty tonnes for him selfe the sayd Cowse, and twenty
tonnes for the sayd Elias Watson senior this deponents father, and gave
order to this deponent by the sayd letters to provide one hundred and
twenty pipes of wine to be laden from Palma to England on the sayd

Richard Bere [SIGNATURE, RH SIDE]

To the Interrogatories [CENTRE HEADING]

To the first hee saith hee was spoken unto by one (whose name hee
knoweth not) who said hee was one of the owners of the shipp the
Peter to come and testifie the truth in this cause, and very well
understandeth the nature of primage and average having
bin a merchant these fourtie yeeres, and saith that they are
mentioned in all bills of lading and generally in Charterparties
and for primage hee conceiveth it to be a guift to the mariners
for hoyssing in of the goods, which being one of their primage
primary workes, it hath thence the name as hee conceiveth
and it is in Portugese called Guindage, and that average hath
many significations in maritime matters, as upon casting out
of goods, with lesse of sailes and anchors, but the average in question
hee saith is not (soe farr as hee hath heard) given in
any countrey but in Portugall, and saith the primage belongeth
to the mariners, and average somtimes to the shipp and somtimes
to the merchants, but the average in question being upon a
Portugall designe, belongs and is given to the owners of the
shipp, but the reason hee knoweth not, And otherwise hee
cannot depose saving as aforesaid.

To the second hee saith there is somthing due to the master and
mariners upon taking in the goods or signing the bills of lading
being the foresaid primage, but as to the average in Portugall
voyages aforesaid there is none due to the master, unlesse hee
be a part owner, and then tis done in respect of his ownershipp
and not of his mastershipp; But saith that in respect of
the greate averages that are due and belonging to the owners [?upon]
Brazila voyages from Lisbone and back, the said owners have
bin content and have usually given somthing thereout at the[?ir]
discretion to the master as a gratuitie, which hee knoweth having
severall times bin an Arbitrator betweene owners and masters
upon the occasion, and then the master hath noe other
matter due to him for these voyages but his primage and wages, being to st[XXX]
to the owners courtesie for what hee shall have besides, nothing
due
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.518r Annotate
due to him as master in respect of average, And otherwise saving as
aforesaid hee cannot answer.

To the third hee saith the weare and tare of shipps in the Brazila
voyages is more than otherwise, and therefore they have the better freight,
and that it is therefore the more, because the voyage is longe and into
a hott countrey. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the fourth hee saith that upon losse of cable or anchor, or cutting the
mast for preservation of goods upon a Portugese voyage (from Portugall), the dammadge
hath bin and may be somtimes recovered upon a Consolado, but
hee never knew any recovered upon a Brazeela voyage, and
otherwise he cannot depose.

To the fifth hee answereth negatively for his part, and otherwise
hee cannot answer, saving some masters having bin treated with
and refusing to goe upon the accustomed manner as aforesaid, the
designe hath bin given over.

To the 6th hee saith that those that goe unto the Brazile
voyage use to give or enter ffiansa or securitia in good summes
before the shipps proceeding, to retourne with the lading to the
dominions of Portugall and pay the kings customs, and saith
the owners or their agents are usually the procurers of the Brazila
voyages, and doe ordinarily enter and give the said fiansa, and
otherwise hee cannot depose, saving as aforesaid.

To the seventh hee saith hee doth not conceive the Brazeela
voyage to be any more dangerous to the master and companies health
than other voyages, and saith that besides their primage and
wages, they have commonly private adventures in the shipp, which
obliges them to the defence thereof. And otherwise hee cannot depose
saving as aforesaid.

To the 8th and 9th hee saith hee is nothing concerned in the matter in
question, but hath bin and is concerned as an owner of other shipps
as aforesaid, and hath somtimes allowed somthing to masters
out of average, somtimes more and somtimes lesse according to his
discretion as an owner, and otherwise hee cannot answer saving
that two hundred crownes was the most that ever hee allowed.
saving as aforesaid.

To the 10th hee cannot answer saving as aforesaid, and saving the
master uses to put a peece of eight per day into his account
but it is an the owners discretion to allow it or not.

To the 11th hee saith there is usually from these Northerne
parts to Lisbone allowance to the master and company per pack
or bale of goods namely from England for crosse bound packs or bales of goods six
pence per pack or bale, for each ballet not bound three pence and

To the second Interrogatorie hee saith and deposeth that the said
shipp in the course aforesaid from Nantes for Narmoutier, came
to an anchor in the Roade of Narmoutier about a Cannon shott

a pilote and using those coasts and voyages.

To the third and fourth Interrogatories hee saith and deposeth
that it soe happened that at the time of the said shipps soe comming
to an anchor, there was a Biskayer or some other Spanish man
of warr, anchored in the said roade, whereupon his contest
Eleazar le Merchant the yonger who was master of and went merchant in the
said shipp ffortune, went ashore to speake with the Merchant
that was to lade there the rest of her lading, and that
within the space of an houre after such his going ashore, there came

by the said pilot brought and anchored in a place which hee [XX GUTTER]
and affirmed to be a safe place for the said shipp to ride in, but
in truth was a dangerous place, being upon a ledge of rocks,
which hee knoweth being present and knowing the premisses.

To the fifth Interrogatorie hee saith and deposeth that the weather
speedily after the said shipps soe being brought last to an anchor
grew tempestuous, and the tempest in the night time increased
more and more, by meanes whereof the said shipp (the
sea falling away and tide abating) bilged upon the said rocks
and sanck and became full of water in the
hould through leak&amp;#123;i)nes, soe that shee could not be set out

and money paid them after that rate. And saith that hee being a pilot
well knoweth the valew of soe much worke and materialls, and
saith it was worth nine hundred livers and more and soe much to his remembrance
it cost, And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the eighth hee saith that by reason of the said disaster, many of
the said shipps company threatened to leave her, whereby the said
Eleazor le Marchaut was forced to come to a new composition
or agreement with them, and to give them a monethes wages more
than their first agreement or thereabouts, which hee knoweth for

To the third and fourth and fifth Interrogatories he saith and deposeth that there was a
Biskayer or other Spanish man of warr anchored alsoe in the
said Roade at the sametime whereupon Eleazar le Merchaut master of the said
shipp ffortune (who was alsoe Sopra cargo in respect of part of
her lading) went ashore to the end (as hee said) to speake with the [?said GUTTER]
Merchaut to whom hee was consigned, to and to know whether the
place where the shipp was anchored was convenient to take in her
ladeing or not, and saith then about three quarters of an houre
or an houre after such his going ashore, there came a pilot aboard
as sent from the said merchaut of [?Narmontier] and acquainted this deponent and her
company aboard, that the place wherein they lay was not convenient
and safe in regard of the danger of the said Biskayer, and that
hee was sent by Mr Gazeau to bring her into a more convenient
and safe place, nearer the shore for the taking in of the rest of her lading; and
thereupon after the said shipp had tarried about foure howers at anchor
in the place where shee was as aforesaid brought to anchor, the said
pilote soe comming from thence caused her to be thence removed
to goe nearer the shore and in such removall brought her upon a
Sand banck, whence shee was quickly after gott off againe, and
then endeavouring still to bring her nearer the shore hee brought
her to an anchor in a place which hee said was safe and convenient
but it proved farr other, it being over a rock, upon which rock
the said shipp in the night upon the falling away of the tide and
a greate tempest arising (as hee saith it did) bilged and beate
in such manner, that being thereby made exceeding leakie, shee
received water in such abundance that shee sanck and was
full of water in the hold, and could not be set to sea againe
without first repairing and amending, which All which hee
knoweth being masters mate, and present and being the things
so happen.

To the sixth article hee saith that by reason of the said bilging
and beating of the said shipp against the rock and her leakinesse
and taking in water and sinking as aforesaid, shee remained [?and GUTTER]
was underwater about seaven dayes together, before shee could
be gotten up, in which there were sometimes two and [?sometimes GUTTER]
three boates or more and twenty or five and twenty men

whereof was broken, and two of her planckes, and [XXX GUTTER]

To the seaventh hee saith that there were three or foure carpenters
imployed about repairing the said shipp for eight or nine dayes
together or thereabouts to worke day and night as the tide [XXX GUTTER]

there to go perfect her lading for England by the said Lonys direction which was to bee putt on board

To the 4th hee saith that the said shipp under the said Masters Conduct did as
aforesaid sayle to Narmontier aforesaid, and there came to an anchor within
a Canon shott of the said Island in a convement roade where shipps sayleing
for that place doe usually anchor which hee knoweth being a Pilott versed
in those Coasts and voyages, and being as aforesaid aboard the said shipp:

To the 5th and 6th hee saith that the said shipp being come to an anchor as aforesaid
the said Master went shortly after a shore to speake with the said Mr La
Gistiere Gazeau to whom the said shipp was consigned and recommended by the
said de Loney ffardiere and shortly after in the said shipps boate a pilott
came aboard by the direction and order of the said Mr Gazeau to bring the
said shipp neerer to the Land for that there was a man of warr belonging to the
Spaniards neere that place, which might as was conceived surprize and take out
of the said shipp the Aquavites aforesaid or words to that effect And saith that the Custome of that
place is, that when any shipp is to bee brought neerer to Land than usuall and
ordinary place where the said shipp first anchored as aforesaid, then there is usually
employed a Pilott of that place to conduct in and anchor such shipp or shipps
Which hee well knoweth for the reason aforesaid And otherwise cannot depose

To the 7th hee saith, That after the said shipp had been anchored in the usuall and
ordinary roade as aforesaid, for about fower or fiver houres, the said Pilott by the
order and direction as hee said, of the said La Gistiere Gazeau caused the anchor to
bee weighed, and tooke upon him the charge of conducting the said ship to the place
where hee shortly after brought her to anchor beeing as hee said a place
of security, but that it shortly afterwards proved a dangerous and disastrous
pace, being close to the rocks, and sand bancks, and too narrow for such a shipp
conveniently to ride in, which this deponent saith hee knoweth by dangerous
and sadd experience./

To the 8th hee saith that after the said shipp was soe brought to an anchor
by the said Pilotts direction, a tempestuous weather and the night time
shortly ensued, and that the said shipps Companye being then all of them on board
used their utmost endeavours to prevent the shipps disaster which happened
by her bilgeing upon the adjacent rocks, whereby shee became very leaky
and her hould was full of water, and the said vessells of Aquavites floated in
the hould of the said shipp, which hee well knoweth being an Eyewittnesse
thereof And further cannot depose/

To the 9th hee saith that presently after the said disaster the first and great
endeavour of the said Master and Companie was to save the said Aquavites which
accordingly was done with boates and hoyes thereunto hired and employed, they in the
meane time not using any endeavour for the preservation of the said shipps
tackle and furniture. Which hee knoweth being an Eye wittnes of and assistant
in the premisses:-/

To the tenth hee saith, That in the saving of the said goods, a boate that was employed
about the same was lost and perished, which for hee verily beleeveth was worth
about fower pounds sterling which, as hee hath credibly understood, the said Master
was enforced by order of Justice to pay to the Owners of the said boate

To the eleaventh hee saith, That the said Aquavites being soe saved and putt
on board the hoyes thereunto employed, the said Le Marchaut was constrained to
hire men to preserve the same from the Countrey people, who would have seized
upon the same as a wreck or wracked goods, as they called them, and the sayd hoyes
and men were to that purpose necessarily employed and kept in pay by the said
Le Merchaut till such time as the said shipp was weighed up and repayred.
Which the premisses hee knoweth for the reason and by the meanes aforesaid:/

To the 12th and 13th hee saith that the Rudder of the said shipp was broken, and severall
plankes and part of the keele were splitt in pieces, and shee by the meanes aforesaid
became soe much damnified, that thirty daies and upwards were spent in
the weighing up, and repairing of the same, during all which time the said
hoyes and men were necessarily employed for the preservation of the said

To the first Interrogatories after showing unto him the writings
interrogated formerly brought into this Court and his persusall thereof hee
answereth and saith that he did not write the said second, third and fourth
or fifth letters or schedules hee being than infirme by reason of
some hurt received, but hee firmed the said second, third and fourth
with his owne hand as now appeareth and gave order for the writing
of them all foure, but by whose hand they were written hee saith he doth not
nowe remember, for that this deponent a little before having received
a dangerous wound in his right hand wrist, upon which he kept his bed
and having occasion at and about the time of writing the
said foure letters and while hee soe kept his bed to write many letters [?and GUTTER]
despatches
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.547r Annotate
dispatches and other things, hee hired and imployed severall persons (that use
to write upon hire) to write for him, some at one time, and some at another
as one mr Christopher Jobe and others, and some one or other of them he saith wrote
the said letters, but who in particular it was hee is not certaine
but supposes it might be the said Jobe: and for the first schedule
or bill of lading hee saith the same was and is as he beleeveth
true and reall
But as to the said foure letters hee saith that the
first three thereof namely the second, third and fourth schedules were and
are in the contents thereof entirely fictitious and supposed and not reall
and were written only to colour secure the goods from seizure by the
Spaniards at the Canaries, and from the dunkerkers in case they should meete
with the said shipp in her retourne And for the said fourth letter, which is written
and directed to mr ffernandez, hee saith that the same was and is in part
true and reall and in part fictitious and colourable, namely for what
mentions mr ffernandez and his account hee said the same was and is true
and reall, but for soe much thereof as mentions any of the said goods
to be belonging to this deponent, or Antonio de Ponte, hee saith the same is
fictitious, and written for the reason aforesaid to preserve the said goods soe
going under the names of this deponent and mr de Ponte from seizure
by the Spaniards or dunquirkers, and whereas in truth the whole
parcell really belongs to mr ffernandez, Concerning whom hee saith that
his Spanish name would possibly have secured those put in his name from seizure
at Teneriff, in case the bill found there have bin found, but this deponent
not knowing and under which nation either of Englishman or Spaniard the
dunkirkers would aspect him, but rather supposing that they (living
neerer and better knowing him) would looke upon or at him as an English
man, this deponent consigned the smaller part in the said letter to him for his owne account because
that in case of the shipps carrying into dunkirke, the greater part might
be recovered and the dunkirkers might take the contents of the said letter to be
the more reall as to the other two parts of goods finding some consignment therein for account of mr ffernandez
living in England, whom in likelihood they would make to be an Englishman
or subiect of this nation, and to this effect he saith it was agreed between
mr ffernandez and this deponent before this deponents departure hence, and
mr ffernandez ordered him to write in that manner. and saith the said
foure letters with the said bill of lading upon the boats last coming ashore
before the ships departure from Teneriff, this deponent gave to one of the
ships company (coming to his lodging to see what hee would have aboard) and
ordered him to deliver the same to the said John danielson to be carried in
the shipp. But the reall letter being that annexed to the foresaid allegation
and dated the 4th June 1656 (new stile) and said hee sent thereby his
servant John Bailehach and ordered him to keepe it very secret and to
to deliver it to mr ffernandez. And otherwise saving his foregoing deposition hee
cannot depose, saving the said bill of lading hee received of mr Painter
by whome hee was desired to send it, and by whome alsoe he was desired to
write the first letter.

To the second hee saith hee is a Roman Catholik, and maketh a conscience
of the oath with which hee hath taken in this cause, and beleeveth himselfe bound
thereby to speake the truth, and that it should be a mortall sinne in him
to
~~~

to speak or depose untruely in this cause to save the goods in question
or for any other consideration whatsoever, or against persons of
what profession of Religion soever, may having taken a lawfull
oath (as hee saith hee hath donne in this business) hee conceiveth himselfe
bound to speake the truth, though it were for or against a Turke
much more a Christian though differing from the Roman profession
and there without any dispension of absolution, and otherwise hee
conceiveth the question captious, and nothing concerning this cause hee knoweth not.

To the third hee saith hee well knoweth the interrogated Ignatio de
Londohola, and Antonia de Ponte, and is himselfe the other person
interrogated, and saith they are all Spaniards, subiects of the King of
Spaine, and acknowledge themselves for such.

To the fourth hee saith the said shipp was wholly freighted by the
said mr ffernandez for the said voyage, and that all her
outward lading (within a small matter) was belonging to him, but not all the homewards
lading. and saith hee this examinate
at the Canaries entered and owned the said exported goods as his
owne, and there hee owned and tooke upon him to be the owner
of the said goods there laden aboard her by him, but made entrie
thereof as belonging to the said severall persons mentioned
the said three last letters namely in the fourth third, fourth and fifth
schedules nowe showed unto him namely to Ignatious de Landahola, Antonio
de Ponte, Antonio ffernandez Caravajall and this deponent according
to the said letters, and otherwise cannot answer saving what followes.

To the fifth hee saith hee went factor the said voyage as
aforesaid, and was to be to all the said shipps lading in regard
of her freight, but hee laded at the Canaries only the
foresaid mechandizes soe belonging to mr ffernandez, for
whom not having goods enough, hee yeelded to others to
supplie the rest of the lading which shee brought home, as to
the said Painter and others, but the kindes or quantities soe laden
by thoseothers hee remembreth not, but referreth himselfe
therein to their bills of lading, And otherwise saving his
foregoing deposition hee cannot answer.

To the 6th hee referreth himselfe to his foregoing deposition to the
fourth Interrogatorie and saith hee said and gave out at the time
of her lading that all the said homewards cargo was belonging
to the said Ignatio de Landahola, Antonio de Ponte and this
deponent (namely all the merchandize that was laden aboard
her at the Canaries) without saying or telling to any and those
that any part thereof belonged to mr ffernandez; only as occasion
served hee spake or said what he thought most conducing to
make the lading there seem to be for Spaniards, and saith hee
knoweth the interrogated mr Chillingworth and saw him on the Iland
of Teneriff, and beleeveth hee told him as hee did severall
others, that hee would for colour consigne the said goods some to mr ffernandez
and some to other English and that they were belonging to this examinate
and the said Landohola and de Ponte, which hee soe said and gave
out to prevent any discovery there of their belonging
to mr ffernandez, and to colour them for him. And otherwise
hee beleeveth not saving as aforesaid

To the 7th Interrogatorie hee saith that hee beleeveth that there passed
discourse betwixt the interrate Mr Chillingworth and this examinate to the
effect interrogated, and that this deponent as hee beleeveth did or might
answer him as is interrogated, and more full to that effect, for hee saith
it being his endeavour that everyone there should beleeve
the said goods to be belonging to Spaniards hee this examinate said as much
as hee could to induce any with whom hee discoursed thereabouts (which
was with many soe to beleeve, but all was in colour only and
to preserve them to mr ffernandez.

To the 8th hee saith that the said exported lading was at the
canaries sold for sixteene hundred pounds (sterling) or thereabouts,
and were sold to soe many persons that hee remembreth not all their
names, but some hee doth, namely Don Simon de Herrera, don Christoval
de Alvarado, and don Bernardo de Armand[?aris], of whome alsoe hee
bought part of the said goods soe laden as aforesaid for the said mr
ffernandez account at Teneriff, and the rest of others, some with money
and some upon truck for some of the exported goods. And saith the
foresaid wines and hides soe laded at Teneriff by this deponent
for the said ffernandez as aforesaid cost sixtie five thousand Realls
(accounting eight Reals, to a peece of eight) or thereabouts

deposition where he hath satisfied the same./

subscription of the said letters, but saith the said John was this deponents
servant as aforesaid, referring himselfe to his foregoing deposition, and
went in noe other qualitie but as this deponents servant or apprentice.

To the eleventh hee saith that at the request of the said mr Painter, this
deponent caused the said first letter or second schedule of those remaining
in Court to be written, to the end to colour the goods therein mentioned
by making them seeme to be belonging to Spaniards, and this deponent
beleeveth they are belonging to the said mr Painter, but what the said
Mr Page hath owned or refused to owne or sweare hee knoweth not, and
otherwise saving his foregoing deposition, hee cannot answer.

deponent two pipes of wine (which were laden aboard and as hee

To the first article of the sayd allegation hee saith hee this deponent went with
the arlate daniell Jeggles the voyage in question, and did thereby observe that
hee behaved him selfe that voyage like an able sea man and one fitt to bee
a Master and Commander of a shipp And saith his this deponents father went alsoe with him that voyage and

voyages in, and hee this deponent hath heard his sayd father saye that in
these voyages the sayd Jeggles did alsoe behave him selfe like an able sea man
and a man fitt to take command of shipps, And hee saithfor a skill full Seaman,
and a man fitt to bee Master and Commander of a ship the sayd Jeggles
was and is Commonly accompted and reputed, and (as hee hath heard by
divers aunchient and expert seamen, and beleeveth) hath bin soe reputed for many
yeares last past And further to this article hee cannot depose/

To the second article hee saith hee knoweth the Port of Porto Port in Portugall
and saith it is not only a barrd port, but hath alsoe on the larboard side getting
in, severall rocks, which occasion much danger to shipps in goeing [?into GUTTER]
any strong streame of freshwater come, (as some tymes it doth) downe the
harbour or Port, and alsoe by reason that the barr doth (as hee hath heard
Pyllotts who are well acquainted therewith saye) often shifte and alter from
one side to an other, And hee saith by reason of the danger of the sayd barr
the sayd Port is to be entered but at some tymes as about three quarters
flood, and then usually with the helpe of some Pylott either belonging tp
Porto Port, or liveing neere, and being well acquainted with the sayd
Port, And hee as hee hath credibly heard noe shipps though belonging
to that place doe passe into that Port without a Pyllott by the reason of
the dangers aforesayd And further hee cannot depose/

To the 3 article of the sayd allegation hee saith for that hee was one of the
Company of the shipp, whereof the sayd Jeggles was Master the voyage
in question hee knoweth that the sayd shipp came first neere to Porto Port
about the twelfth of November 1654 and in the morning about two or
three a Clock, and that it was then very darke, and the winde Easterly
and a very scant winde, by reason of which darkenesse of the morning
and scantnesse of the winde the arlate Jeggles did over shoote the
port of Porto Port and went to the Southward of it about three leagues,
the premisses hee the better knoweth for that hee this deponent and
this deponents father who was Masters Mate, and the Boatswaine and William
Jeggles and others of the shipps company were then upon the Watch And
further to these articles hee cannot depose/

To the 4th 5th and 6th hee saith that the next day being (as hee remembreth)
The 13th of November 1654 the sayd Jeggles came againe with his shipp
before Porto Port, and acccording as the custome here is, shott off two or
three gunnes to give notice for a Pylott to come aboard and carrie in the sayd
shipp, but none coming, and the flood being spent, and night approaching
and it being likely to prove stormie weather, the sayd Jeggles to
prevent the danger of being driven on grounds and the better to secure
the shipp and goods and his and his companyes lives, did cause the sayd
shipp to be putt off from shoare to Sea, And accordingly that
night the weather proceded very stormy and the winde blew very
stronge to shoare, soe that the sayd shipp if shee had continued all
night neere Porto Port and had not stood off to sea had without doubt
perished in the sea togeather with her ladeing and Company And
soe

HCA 13/71 f.564r Annotate
soe much was well observed by this deponent and the rest of the sayd
shipps company then on board her, And saith the fowerteenth day of the sayd
moneth the weather continueing still stormie and the winde bloweig
then northerly soe that there was noe likelyhood (in this deponents Judgment)
of gaineing Porto Port without the winde altered and weather proved
lesse stormie, the sayd Jeggles did carry the sayd shipp and goods to
Lisbore arlate where shee safely arrived about the fifteenth day of the
sayd moneth, but by whose direction or order hee carried her thither hee knoweth
not, yet beleeveth, (for that the arlate Cowses brother who went supracargoe
of the sayd shipp was on board) the same was done by his order, or consent
at least, it being a thing usuall for Masters of shipps if they have a Supra
Cargoe on board to advise with them, And further hee cannot depose/

To the 7th article hee saith that after the sayd ship came to Lisborne
the greatest part of her ladeing was there receaved on shoare by the
arlate Edmond Corse or his order, and there by him selfe or otherwise
disposed of and other goods by him put on board her, by which meanes the
sayd shipp was there deteyned in enladeing the goods brought, thither, and
takeing in the other goods there laden aboard her, from the tyme of her sayd
arrivall in November 1654 till december next following, the premisses
hee deposeth of his owne sight and knowledge being one of her company and
on board And further cannot depose./

To the 8th hee saith that the sayd shipp being laden and by the sayd Edward
Cowse discharged, a Pylott was put on board her (and by the sayd Cowse
as hee hath heard and beleeveth) and shee ordered to proceede for
Porto Port, And the sayd Jeggles in obedience to such order did presently
endeavour to goe out with her but was hindered sometymes by fowle weather and
sometymes by other accidents, as by being made staye of, by the
Governour of a Castle neere Lisbone, upon pretense of searching
for a fryer who (as it was sayd) was runne away), and saith shee was by him
stayed divers dayes, but how longe hee remembreth not, all which
staye there at Lisbone was occasioned either by fowle weather or
Crosse windes, or by Commands of the sayd Governour and his officers,
and not through any default of the sayd Jeggles or any of his
Company the premisses hee deposeth for the reasons aforesayd And further
cannot depose/

To the 9th hee saith that the moneth of ffebruary 1654 and about the
beginning thereof (the tyme neere certainly hee remembreth not) the
sayd Jeggles gott with his sayd shipp the Anne out of Lisbon with the
sayd Pylott on board him, and but the winde and weather proceeding crosse
and stormie, the sayd shipp beate up and downe before the Port of Porto Port about
a weekes space before shee could gett in, and at length in the sayd
moneth of ffebruary (but what day therof hee remembreth not) shee
with much difficulty gott safe into Porto Port, with her ladeing, this
hee deposeth upon the grounds of knowledge as aforesayd And further cannot depose/

To the 10th and 11th and 12th articles of the sayd allegation hee saith that the sayd
shipp the Anne from Porto Port went to Barbadoes, and from thense to
New England, and thense back to the Barbadoes and from thense to Virginia and in her course from Barbadoes to Virginia hee saith shee mett
with extraordinary stormy weather, and by force thereof lost her foremast
fore top mast, sayles, yards and all her rigging saveing her foreyarde and
foresayle and was thereby damnified in her hull and [?XXXX] her forecastle [?XXX] both [?alofte] and belowe (by helpe of which foreyarde and foresayle with much difficulty shee gott to Virginia)
where the sayd Jeggles was for want of sayles and other
rigging and by reason of the dammage done to her by the sayd storme constrayned to lye till about the beginning of Aprill last one thousand
sixe hundred and fifty sixe, during which tyme the sayd Jeggles of this deponents
knowledge did doe his utmost to fitt and furnish the sayd shipp to goe thense
for the Barbadoes againe, but Virginia being a place that will not
afford sayles and rigging for a shipp to make her in fitt capacity to goe
thense to the Barbadoes, the sayd Jeggles was forced to make
shifte with that fore yarde and fore sayle and the helpe of a topp sayle which
hee caused to be made of an old sayle which was on board the sayd
shipp to come for England with such ladeing as hee could procure at
Virginia which was only a smale quantie of hogsheads
of tobaccoe taken at freight for severall planters at Virginia, and
some few hogsheads more for other persons (but for whome hee knoweth not)
which was all the sayd Jeggles could gett by reason there were
many shipps then in Virginia and that they had gotten what other
ladeing was to bee then had there, notwithstanding (of this deponents
knowledge) the sayd Jeggles did endeavour what hee could to get
ladeing thense, either for England, holland, or Ireland, And this
deponent knoweth that a shipp of London called the Sea horse which
was then alsoe in Virginia (and a board which this deponent went
severall tymes before her departure thence) came from Virginia hath
only about a hundred hogsheads of tobacco which was not above
halfe her ladeing which shee could have brought for England And
further hee cannot depose

To the 13 hee saith hee heard one of the freighters (a planter of
Virginia who laded some hogsheads of tobacco aboard the sayd
shipp Anne sayd in presence of this deponent and others of the Company of the Anne that hee and the other planters who laded tobacco
on board her did condition with the sayd Jeggles to have the same transported for Ireland,
and that the said Jeggles should then staye with the sayd shipp five
dayes to make sale thereof, and in case it could not bee there sold, then
to transporte it thence to England, and that they would not have
laden the same on board the sayd shipp but upon these conditions
And further hee cannot depose./

To the 14th hee saith that of hee this deponents sight and knowledge, the sayd Jeggles
did not, either at Virginia or any other Port or place, neglect any tyme
but did his best endeavour for the benefitt and advantage of the said
articulate James and Edmund Cowse soe farr as hee this deponent could and
did observe And further hee cannot depose/

To the 15th hee saith hee hath heard his father and other experienced seamen saye
that it is about five hundred and forty leagues betwixt Virginia and the Barbadoes
and about a thousand five hundred leagues betwixt Barbadoes and England And
saith as aforesaid it was in this deponents Judgement a thing impossible to fitt
and amend the shipp Anne at Virginia with such things as she there wanted to carry
her to the Barbados, and soe likewise at the Barbadoes to fitt her there with such
things as she had lost, and to amend her hull which was alsoe much preiudiced
and her forecastle torne both belowe and alofte, And further hee cannot depose

To the 16th hee saith the shipp Anne aforesayd in her course homeward
for London was of this deponents knowledge being one of her Company forced to put
into Plymouth by reason of Contrary windes, and alsoe to avoide being
taken by dunkirke or Ostend or other Spanish men of warr who this deponent
sawe hovering up and downe at sea upon that coast, and saith of his knowledge
the sayd ship Anne departed from Plymouth for London with the first oportunitie
of wynde and weather which offered itselfe And further cannot depose

To the last hee saith that in his this deponents Judgement and as he verily
beleeveth and is perswaded in his concience that in case the sayd shipp
Anne had endeavoured to have gone from Virginia to the Barbadoes
thence to England, shee being soe damnified in her hull and by losse of
her tackle as aforesayd (which dammage and losse of tackle could
not bee supplyed and amended neither at Virginia nor Barnadoes such
things requisite to mend her not being in those places to bee had) shee
had without doubt sunke and perished in the sea shee being of this deponents knowledge kept with continuall pumping night and day, after the dammage receaved And further hee

arrived before it againe upon the Monday morning, and then seeing boates
at sea, put out this auncient length waies in [?wesse], to cause the sayd boates,
to come to him, but the sayd boates companyes (fearing as this deponent beleeveth that
the shipp Ann had been some Turkish man of warr, they often frequenting
that coast) made away from her and then the sayd Jeggles discharged some
peeces of ordnance to envite a pylott on board, and none comming,
and night approaching, the sayd Jeggles stood off to Sea as is predeposed

voyages with the sayd Jeggles wherein the sayd Jeggles went Master and
Commander of shipps, videlicet three voyages to Barbadoes two to Virginia
and two to New England, the voyage now in question which voyage is to be accounted, wherein this
deponent alsoe went as one of the Company of the Anne whereof the sayd
Jeggles was Master, and saith in all the sayd voyages the sayd daniell
Jeggles behaved him selfe like an able and expert seaman and one fitt
to bee a Master or Commander of a shipp, and hee is of this deponents
knowledge an able expert seaman and fitt to goe Commander of any shipp,
and soe commonly reputed and taken to bee among sea men and
Masters of shipps and such as are skilled in Navigation./

in Portugall and saith it is of this deponent knowledge a barrd port
and not to be entered into but about three quarter flood by reason
of

of the great hazard and danger thereof and that all shipps though belonging
to that place doe use the assistance of some Pylott resideing there or neere
thereabouts to goe into the sayd harbour And this is a thing well knowne to
all sea men that have occasion to goe to the sayd Port And further
hee cannot depose./

To the 3 article of the sayd allegation that upon or about the twelfth
of November 1654 and about two or three of the Clock in the morning
(it then being very darke by reason the moone was then sett) the sayd daniell
Jeggles came with his shipp the Anne whereof he was Master neere to
Porto Port articulate at which tyme hee well remembereth there did blow
a very scant Easterly gale of wynde And saith that by reason of the scantnesse
of the winde and darkenesse of the morning the sayd daniell Jeggles and his

leagues and not above, and were to the Southwards of it about three or fower

gunnes to give notice for a pylott to come aboard to carrie in the
sayd shipp, but none came from shoare, though the sayd Jeggles stayed in
expectation thereof severall houres and the flood being spent, and
night approaching and the winde beginning to be high, and it being likely
to prove fowle weather, the sayd Jeggles to prevent danger of his shipp being driven
on ground did for the more securitie of her and her ladeing and her companys
lives carry her off to sea further from shoare And the same night it proved
very stormie weather and the winde blew very strongly toward shoare soe
that in this deponents judgement hee verily beleeveth and is perswaded in
his conscience had the sayd shipp continued all night before Porto Port and
not made out to sea as shee did, shee would by the violence of the
winde have bin driven on shoare and bin in great danger of perishing
in the sea both shee and her ladeing and her Company, and soe much was
manifest and apparent to all the sea men then on board her and hee saith
that the next day (being the fourteenth of the sayd moneth) the winde blew
Northerly and the weather continued very stormie and tempestious
soe that unlesse the winde and weather had altered there was in this deponents
Judgement and the Judgement of the rest of the seamen aboard noe hope to gaine
Porto Port, and therupon the sayd Jeggles did by order of the articulate

an extraordinary strong fresh out of the River of Porto Port

reason of the smale quantitie thereof unwilling to goe with it to any
place but to England the sayd Laders fell out with the sayd Jeggles

(by reason hee this deponent was busied about getting the boates in a
readinesse according to Commands) hee did not heare, but coming on
board while they soe continued at difference hee heard the sayd Gosling
openlly upon the deck saye this or the like in effect I was told by Mr
Batson and other Merchants that nothing should bee done in their
voyage by you (meaning the sayd damerell) of any concernement without
your adviseing first with mee and this is a matter that may concerne
the shipp and our lives, and may prove the losse of the voyage and our
lives alsoe, and if wee leave the Company of the other shipps (
meaning the shipps of the sayd Pybus Welch Goulding and Child) and
worke further into the Ice wee may come to repent it too late
And the sayd damerell therto replyed and speakeing to the
sayd Gosling sayd, you, I looke upon you as nothing,
and as a simple fellowe, and a Pimpe, and other the like angrie
and reproachfull speeches whereto the sayd Gosling replyed and
sayd thus or the like in effect I come of as good parentage as you and
am as good a man as you and am noe more a pimpe than you, and this
deponent being busied about getting things in readinesse in order
to be workeing the sayd shipp further in according to command, did
not minde what other angrie speeches passed then betwixt the sayd
damerell and Gosling: But saith the sayd Gosling notwithstanding
whatsoever speeches passed betweene them did of this deponents

further to these articles hee cannot depose, saving hee saith that
nothing spoken or done by the
sayd Maundrie or Gosling either then or at any tyme after during
the voyage in question was as hee beleeveth any hinderance that the

receaved this hee knoweth for that after the Owners Adventure and Greyhound
were gott out of the Ice to sea they found her in that dangereous condition and
helped her to stopp her leake and cleere her of warter as aforesayd, And saith
that when the Owners Adventure turned back to goe to sea shee was a good
way from shoare (but how many leagues hee knoweth not) nor how Bell
Point then bore, and that in his this deponents Judgment (by reason of the thicknesse
of the Ice towards shoare neare then towards sea) it was farr greater danger

Roape Maker aged thirty eight yeares or thereabouts a
wittnesse sworne and examined saith and deposeth as
followeth videlicet./

To the first article of the sayd allegation hee saith that hee this deponent was
one of the Company of the Owners Adventure for the voyage in question
and hyred by the arlate Thomas damerell to goe the same and saith the
voyage was a Greeneland voyage for fishing for whales and the sayd damerell
went Master of her that voyage and the arlate Gosling and Maundrie were
his two mates of her the sayd voyage but who shipped them for mates hee
knoweth not And further cannnot depose/

To the 2 hee saith hee cannot depose for that hee heard not any such order or direction
as is arlate given to the sayd damerell by the arlate Batson Beane and the
rest of the Imployers of the Owners Adventure nor sawe any order or direction
in writing to that effect./

To the third hee saith that upon or about the second of June last 1656
the arlate Gosling Maundrie this deponent and the rest of the Company of
the Owners Adventure brought the sayd shipp within about three or
fower leagues of Bell Point and the Port then boare North east
of the sayd shipp, and the sayd shipp being there the sayd damerell
went on board of the shipp named the Adventure of Hill whereof the arlate John
Pybus was Master, and stayed aboard her three watches which is
about twelve howers, and that not longe after the sayd damerell soe went on
board the sayd Pybus his shipp, the sayd Pybus his shipp sett sayle with
the sayd damerell in her, and went off to sea wards and from wards the
Port, and in the tyme damerell stayed aboard her went soe off fromwards the
Port about tenn leagues, and the arlate Maundrie and Gosling and the
rest of the Owners Adventure followed the sayd Pybus his shipp
the sayd tenn leagues before the sayd damerell returned aboard the
Owners Adventure, where as the sayd Gosling Maundrey this deponent
and

and the rest of the Owners Adventure in regard the sayd shipp was
then gotten soe neere Bell Point, did expect that the sayd damerell
would rather have come againe on board his owne shipp the Owners Adven=
ture and caused her to nee made fast to the Ice there, which if hee
had done, hee might in all probability have gotten with her safe into
Bell Sound, hee having then (in the Judgment of this deponent and in the
Judgment of divers others of the Owners Adventure (as hee heard them
alsoe saye) the most probable and fittest oportunity of getting into
harbour that presented it selfe during the sayd voyage And further
to this article hee cannot depose./

To the 4th 5th and 6th articles of the sayd allegation hee saith (for that hee kept a
noate or memoriall in writing of the tyme of the shipp Owners Adven=
ture upon the Coast of Greeneland and of the tymes of her passage
up and downe to severall places there) hee knoweth that
after the sayd damerell came from on board the sayd Pybus his shipp hee
kept company with the sayd Pybus his shipp and the shipps whereof Mr Golding
Welch and Child were masters, all shipps belonging to this Port of
London, till about the fifteenth day of
the sayd moneth of June last, and upon that fifteenth day of
the sayd damerell with his shipp the Owners Adventure (and the Greyhound
a Pinke belonging to her and alsoe under the Command of the sayd damerell
and the sayd Pybus Golding Welch and Child their shipps, began to worke
into the Ice togeather, and the Ice being very thick, they in about fower and
twenty howers space with hard labour gott about seaven leagues into
the Ice, and then all the sayd shipps (their companyes being tyred and the
Ice soe thicke that they could not well gett any further) made  fast to the Ice
And the Owners Adventure and Greyhound and the sayd Welch and
Goldings shipps lying board and board one of an other, lashed fast
one of an other, and soe laye about tenn howers, in which tyme
the sayd damerell went on board the shipps of the sayd Goulding and
Welch, but what discourse there happened betwixt the sayd damerell and
them aboard their shipps hee knoweth not, but saith that upon the seaventeenth
day of the sayd Moneth of June the sayd damerell standing on board
the sayd Gouldings shipp, called to his Company of the Owners
Adventure and (in a bravado as hee this deponent beleeveth and
to expresse that hee would adventure further then any other shipps would)
bidd them and the Greyhounds Company loose their shipps and
strive to worke in further, and soone after hee came on board the
Owners Adventure, and renued his Commands, and commanded
the Company to make ready their shallops to worke
further in, And the Companyes of the Owners Adventure and
Greyhound beginning to loose the shipps and gett their shallopps
off of the Ice in order to obey the sayd damerells commands, the
sayd damerell from on board the Owners Adventure called to the
sayd

HCA 13/71 f.582v Annotate
sayd Goulding and Welch and asked them whether they would worke
further in or not, whereupon they replyed and sayd that they sawe noe
probability of getting in any further, and that they would worke out to sea
againe, and expect a better oportunitie or words to that effect whereto the sayd
damerell replyed and sayd if they would not, yet hee would worke further
in, or words to that effect, And thereupon continued his Commands to the
Company of the Owners Adventure and Greyhound to make ready to worke
further, whereupon the arlate Gosling having bin at rest in his Cabbin
(it not being his watch) heraring a noyse came up and in a Civill manner
asked of the sayd damerell whether hee meant to goe with the sayd shipp
whereto the sayd damerell in an angrie manner replyed and sayd
thus or the like in effect, what is that to you Jack an Apes, I looke not upon
you as one to bee made acquainted, whereto the sayd Goslin in a Civill
manner replyed and sayd thus or to the like effact, Sir I was told by the
Marchants when I was hyred that nothing should bee done in the
voyage, of great concernement without the advice of us your mates
(meaning him selfe and the sayd Maundrie) and of the harpooneeres,
and this is a matter of great concernement and may conserne
the shipp and our lives, and may tend to the advance or preiudice
of the voyage, therefore I pray you consider, for doubtlesse there are
as able men in the other shipps (meaning the shipps of the sayd Welch
Goulding Pybus and Child) as any of us and whoe would not bee backward
to advance their voyage in what they may, and if wee leave their
Company and come to any extremity wee may repent it too late
Whereupon the sayd damerell, without any other provocation given
him by the sayd Gosling then before is declared (soe farr as this
deponent could or did observe) spake in an angrie manner to the sayd
Gosling and sayd hee looked upon him, but as one of his Cabbin
boyes, and called him pimpeing Rogue or words to that effect
all which the sayd Gosling did beare with patience, and did not
saye or doe any thing to the preiudice of the voyage in question, but
both hee and the arlate Maundrie and the rest of the Owners Adventures
Company did helpe to towe and worke the sayd shipp further into
the Ice towards shoare according to the sayd damerells Commands
and did worke from that tyme on the 17th day of June aforesayd when
they lost the company of the other fower shipps, to the eighteeneth day
thereof, and in that tyme wrought her about fower myles further
into the Ice towards shoare then the other shipps whose Company
they had lost, And saith the words before mentioned passed bwtwixt
the sayd Gosling and damerell upon the forecastle of the Owners
Adventure publiquely in presence and hearing of this deponent and
divers others of the Owners Adventures Company And further to
these articles hee cannot depose./

To the 7th and 8th articles of the sayd allegation hee saith that of his this
deponents sight and observation the arlate Gosling and Maundrie during all
the
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.583r Annotate
the tyme that the sayd shipp was soe in workeing further into the Ice towards
shoare then the other shipps whose company shee had lost, did take great paines
to p?oye off Ice and worke about getting the sayd shipp further in, and did
not in any manner disobey the Commands of the sayd damerell or
refuse to worke, nor (soe farr as this deponent heard or observed) speake to
or encourage any of the sayd shipps Company to disobey the sayd damerells
Commands or to refuse to worke, And saith the sayd shipp being wrought
in the sayd fower myles further or thereabouts, the company being much
wearied therewith by reason of the thicknesse of the Ice, the sayd damerell
commanded the sayd shipp to bee fastned to the Ice that the
Company might rest and refresh them selves, and after they had continued
soe fast about eight howers the sayd damerell came upon the
deck and there openly before this deponent and divers others of the sayd
shipps Company sayd to this effect, that if the other fower shipps whose
company hee had lost did endeavour to worke in after him, then
hee would strive to worke in further towards shoare, but if they wrought
out to sea againe hee would worke out alsoe, and bidd some of the
Company goe up into the shrowdes and see which way the heads of the sayd
shipps stood whether they followed or stood to sea wards, and being told
they stood to sea wards hee the sayd damerell went up into the shroudes
him selfe, as alsoe did one mr Covell, and the sayd damerell having taken
a view and coming downe againe sayd upon the open deck in presence of this
deponent and others of the sayd shipps Company thus or to like in effect
I see they are goeing out to sea, therefore turne our shipp and worke
out after them, whereupon the Company accordingly did begin to worke
her out towards sea, And then the arlate Maundrie sayd I am willing
to helpe worke in, for I did see it was to noe other purpose but to
satisfie the Masters humour, which was all the words this deponent
heard the sayd Maundry saye to expresse any dislike of workeing in,
And saith that soe farr as hee this deponent could or did observe
nothing spoken or done by the sayd Gosling or Maundry were any
cause of the sayd shipps not being then or at any tyme after put
into Port but In this deponents Judgment the extreame thicknesse
of the Ice towards shoare was the cause that hindered the sayd shipp
from getting into harbour or shoare, it being in this deponents Judgment
for the reason aforesayd, a thing impossible to gett her to shoare or harbour,
And saith the sayd shipp was by the order of the sayd damerell wrought
out to sea againe, and being come out, the sayd damerell standing
upon the quarter deck sayd in presence and hearing of this deponent and
others who were upon the deck thus or the like in effect,
that hee was glad hee was out, and they would not bee soe farr in the Ice againe as hee was for
five hundred pounds And further hee cannot depose/

To the 9th hee saith that hee this deponent hath gone severall voyages to
Greeneland with in these tenn or eleven yeares last past and during that tyme
hath
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.583v Annotate
hath knowne the arlate Pybus Welch Goulding and Child and saith
hee knoweth they have bin severall tymes imployed in voyages to Greeneland
and are commonly reputed experienced men in the Greeneland fishing
And saith after the Owners Adventure and Greyhound were gotten out of the
Ice to sea againe and in Company of the shipps of the sayd Golding Welch
Pybus and Child, hee heard divers seamen of the Companyes of the sayd
shipp saye, that it was a very indiscreete part (in their Judgment) of
the sayd damerell to adventure into the Ice soe farr as hee did, and
that they conceived him to bee in great danger in goeing soe farr, And
hee saith the sayd Pybus his shipp by her goeing into the Ice (though not soe
farr as the sayd damerell) or in her workeing in againe, had a hole struck
in her Larboard Bowe with a tongue of Ice whereby shee received tenn
foote water in hold, and was in greate danger of sinkeing and had
undoubtedly perished had not the Companyes of the sayd Golding
Welch and Child their shipps and the Companyes of the Owners Adven=
ture and Greyhound (after they gott out of the Ice and came up to her) helped
to stoppe her leake and pumpe and bayle to cleere her of water
And hee saith in his deponents Judgment the Owners Adventure and
Greyhound when they were gone the sayd ffower myle byeyond the other shipps
and turned about to come out to sea, were about thirteene or twelve leagues
at least from shoare when they turned back, and in this deponents Judgment
the Ice was soe thicke towards shoare when they soe turned back, that in outwards
appearance there was farr greater danger to worke in tooward
shoare then to turne back and make out to sea againe, And further
saveing his foregoeing deposition hee cannot depose/

To the 10th and 11th hee saith that the sayd damerell after hee had
helped as aforesayd to preserve the sayd Pybus his shipp, did loose the
Company of the sayd Pybus Welch Golding and Child by stresse of
weather and foggues, and after hee had lost their Company did
keepe company and consorte him selfe with severall dutch shiipps and
goe on board of them and tooke presents of them as sea horse teeth and a holland cheese and went with them to the Eastward and never
endeavoured for a harbour, only hee went severall tymes to the edge
of the Ice, but seeing it thick returned back to sea againe, And saith that
after the sayd damerell had soe lost the company of the sayd fower English
shipps, the sayd Maundrey did advise the sayd damerell
to goe to the Northwards and to make for Greene harbour, but the sayd damerell
did not followe this advice but went to the Eastward with the fflemings
as aforesayd, and not getting into harbour there, the Company of
the Owners Adventure divers of them fell sick of the scurvie, and
some of the Greyhouns Company dyed thereof, which was occasioned
as hee this deponent beleeveth by reason of their not getting to some
harbour, and want of refreshment on shoare, all which the sayd Maundry and Gosling and the Company
of the sayd shipp patiently endured without disobeying the sayd
damerells Commands, And saith the sayd damerell
not mindeing (for ought appeared to this deponent) to make
for any harbour, went with two or three dutch shipps to a place
called
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.584r Annotate
called Hope Island and there caused about sixteene landsmen of his
Company to flea and blubber sea horses (which the dutch had
killed only to take the teeth of them) and imployed five shallopps crues
of the Owners Adventure to fetch the bloober aboard, and by
these meanes neglected the endeavouring to gaine a harbour,
which hee beleeveth hee might have done if hee had endeavoured
the same, for that hee hath heard divers of the Companyes of the
sayd Pybus Welch Golding and Childs shipps and some of the Masters
them selves of the sayd shipps since their returne to London from the
voyage in question saye, that after they lost the Company of the
Owners Adventure and Greyhound that voyage, they gott into
harbour, some of them into Greene harbour, and others into Port Nick,
and there killed whales and made good voyages, And soe
hee beleeveth might the sayd damerell have done if hee
would have taken the advice of his Mate the sayd
Maundry, and have gone Northwards and made for Greene
harbour as hee advised him after his looseing the Company
of the fower London shipps, and not have gone with the dutch to the
Eastward as hee did: And saith hee knoweth of noe difference
or angrie words which passed betwixt the arlate damerelll Gosling or
Maundrie save those which as is predeposed happened while they
were  in the Ice as aforesayd, and those hee saith were occasioned by the meanes
aforesayd And saith in his this deponents Judgment nothing at
any tyme spoken or done by the sayd Goslin or Maundrey or either
of them was any cause of the overthrowe of the voyage in question
or that it proved soe insuccessefull as it did, but the same
in his Judgment was occasioned by the sayd damerells goeing to
the Eastward with the dutch and not endeavouring to gett
to harbour as in probability hee might, as well as the other shipps
did, and by missing his opportunitie as aforesayd when hee was soe neere Bell Point/ And further hee cannot depose/

To the 12th hee saith hee hath knowne the arlate Maundrie
and Gosling for these eight or nyne yeares last past and hath knowne
them in that tyme make severall voyages to Greeneland as officers
of shipps, and hee this deponent hath gone three severall voyages (whereof the voyage in
question was one) with the sayd Gosling, and saith both the sayd Maundry
and Gosling ever since hee knew them, have bin accompted experi=
enced sea men and men well skilled in the Greeneland ffishing
and persons of good life and conversation and say as have
constantl discharged their places faithfully and soe they both did

a harpooneere that the sayd Parker and Maundrie and Gosling and
humfrie and one Bowling and one Kirke all harponeeres, with their

mentioned, and the sayd Parker first fastned his harpeing Iron in
her, and a while after the sayd humfryes fastned an other Iron
in her, and the rest of the harponeeres by reason of her swifte motion
after shee was pricked not being able to gett soe neere as to
strike any more Irons into her, did make fast their shallopps
to the stearnes of the sayd humfreys and Parkers shallopps,
thereby to tyre the whale with toweing them, and they haveing
bin towed by her eight or tenn howers, she ranne
soe farr into a growne sea that the boates or shallopps tooke in much
water in striveing to continue fast one to the other and to
the whale, and at length the whale turneing shorte did with
swifte motion runne the sayd humfreys shallop stemlings
towards the sayd Parkers shallop, whereupon the sayd humfreys
for preserving his shallopp and crue and to prevent endangereing Parkers shallopp alsoe was forced to cut his
warpe from his Iron and leave his Iron sticking in the whale, whereupon the sayd
humfreys Maundry Gosling and all the other harponeeres
seeing the swifte motion of the whale, and that the sea was
soe rough and growne, gave over any further pursuite of
the sayd whale and went with their shallopps aboard the
Owners Adventure and left the sayd Parker and his Crew (whereof

about three or fower leagues of Bell Point, the Port then bearing north
East of the sayd shipp as hee remembreth, And saith the sayd shipp being
there, Thomas damerell the Master of her came on board this deponents
shipp to advise and did advise with this deponent what was fitt to bee
done in order to get into harbour and this deponent told him that
hee did not thinke it safe to staye there with his this deponents shipp
but was resolved to gett on the outside of the Ice and goe more to
the southwards expecting to gett a better oportunitie of getting into

Edward Bushell of the parish of Saint Ellens
London Marchant, aged 37 yeares or thereabouts
sworne and exámined

To the first and second articles of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth
that for theise twelve yeeres last past and upwards it hath bin the use
and custome in Portugall in freighting of English shipps from Lisbone
for Brazila and back, manned with English men, or the most part with
English, to agree for and expresse by Charter partie a certaine average
(which they there call 'averias') over and besides the freight: which
said average (or 'averias') hath constantly bin allowed and paid by the
freighters of such shipps as belonging and due to the owners
of such shipps and not to the masters. And saith that such average
hath not there in all or at any part of that time (or ever that hee heard)
bin esteemed or understood either by the Portugueses or English to be
due to the masters, but to be belonging to the shipps owners
which hee knoweth, having lived there at Lisbone about six yeares
space, and then and there taking notice of that use and practice,
and having since bin often concerned as an owner in severall English shipps
freighted upon the said voyage to the Portugalls, and never allowed
any such average to the Commanders of such shipps or any of them,
but hee and the rest of the owners have from time to time
received the said average to themselves and their owne uses, and
enjoyed the same as their proper due. And saith that as hee
hath bin informed, the ground of such custome and usage of paying
the said average to the owners, was in consideration of the extraordinary
weare and teare of the shipping and except principally in regard
of the charge in furnishing such shipps with Guns
and ammunition, and expense of such ammunition in that voyage.
And otherwise referring himselfe for the matters deduced in the second article)
to the custome and practize at Lisbone hee cannot depose.

To the Interrogatories. [CENTRE HEADING]

To the first hee saith hee cometh required by mr Ecclestone
and by monition from this Court to testifie the truth in this cause
and saith hee well understandeth the meaning of primage
and average, and that they are often mentioned
in Charterparties made in England; and in bills of lading
there made, primage and average accustomed are frequently
expressed. And further that hee conceiveth that a primage and average
due by Charter parties and bills of lading made in
England to be termes indifferently used, and to signifie a dutie
usually paid to the master for the use of himselfe and shipps company
as a tie upon them to be carefull in the lading and stowing of the
merchandize and the preserving thereof from dammage and imbeazelment
(the danger of the seas excepted) and to be responsible for dammage, or losse

of goods happening by their neglect, and otherwise cannot answer
saving as aforesaid.

To the second hee saith that there is an allowance of a certaine dutie in the said
Brazila voyages to the master and company, under the name of or
terme of 'Gindage', which is there usually paid to the master and
company, as primage and average are in England; and saith
that at such time of his being at Lisbone, there was noe obligation
on the master and company for dammage happening to the goods
in the voyage, but the same was usually laid upon the goods in a generall
average, and therefore they had noe other allowance but their
wages and gindage, saving that some owners have allowed the
Commanders a gratuitie to the valew of fiftie pounds or thereabouts
according to the burthen of the shipp, and that was for his
extraordinary paines and hazard; And otherwise hee cannot answer.

To the third hee saith that the Hollanders being more potent at sea
than the other nations interrogated, and the Portugueses being weake at sea,
the English shipps serving the Portugueses in the foresaid voyages saile
in more hazard and danger, than those that serve the other nations
interrogated. And otherwise hee cannot answer, saving as aforesaid,
and saving hee saith that Brazila is a place whereto wormes
much eate and destroy the shipping, and the heate of the climate
is very destructive to the shipping, and therefore the weare and
teare are the greater.

To the fourth hee cannot answer.

To the 5th hee saith hee doth not knowe of any such treatie
betweene master and owner, saving for the shipp hanibal of
London, which being a shipp of greate burthen and her owners
intending to send her for Portugall there to be freighted for
the Brazila, they to prevent any future differences declared
to the commander that hee should not pretend to the average
for that voyage in case of proceeding thereupon, but hee
insisting to have a part thereof, the owners thereupon altered
their intention of sending her for Portugall, and ordered him
the said commander to lay her in for Italy, howbeit hee
saith that in such treatie, the owners would have given him
some allowance out of the average or otherwise as an incouragement
to ge the said Portugall voyage. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the sixth hee saith that formerly fiansa hath usually
bin given on behalfe of the commander and shipp for their
retourne from Brazila back to Lisbone, and such
fiansa hath usually bin entred or given by the owners or
their factors on their behalfe at Lisbone, who habe procured
the said voyage, And saith that severalll English shipps went
the said voyage before the interrogated dobbins, And otherwise hee cannot
answer saving as aforesaid.

To the 7th hee referreth himselfe to what hee hath predeposed
and
~~~
HCA 13/71 f.593r Annotate
and saith that Brazile though hot, is not an unhealthie climate
as hee hath heard by those that have gonne thither, And otherwise hee
cannot answer.

To the 8th hee saith hee was upon arbitrion to allow to Captaine Wills Commander
of  a shipp the Good Successe wherein hee was concerned as part owner the summe of eightie
mil Res, and to some others some such gratuities have bin by him and
company of owners given according to the qualitie of the shipp, but
the summes hee remembreth not. And otherwise hee cannot answer.

To the 9th hee beleeveth there is none of the said average due
to the masters, in Brazila voyages, and that the reason of
treating before hand with the master of the Hanibal for his not
expecting any of the said average, was to prevent
any future disputes thereabouts, understanding that the average for such voyage
had bin unduely determined by a Commander from other owners,
namely by the interrogated dobbins, and otherwsie hee cannot answer
saving as aforesaid.

To the 10th hee saith it is usuall for owners finding the master
to have bin at extraordinary charges in following the shipps
busines ashore in the said voyage, to allow him some consideration
for the same, towards such charges, sometimes more and
sometimes lesse, and some consideration hath likewise bin had
for allowing some wine and such provisions for the voyage, And
otherwise hee cannot answer saving as aforesaid.

To the 11th hee saith that the primage or average due in
the severall parts and places interrogated is paid according to the custome
of the place, and voyages, but howe much hee knoweth
not certainly, being in some places more and some lesse. And
otherwise hee cannot answer saving as aforesaid.

To the Interrogatories in the second place. [CENTRE HEADING]

To the first and second hee saith that as hee hath heard and beleeveth
his brother John Bushell did as aforesaid in or about the yeare 1650 interrogated
help to let the interrogated Captaine Ell and Captaine Tatam
their shipps to freight for Brazila from Lisborne by Charterpartie
, but the conditions or particulars
of the content or agreement for the said voyage hee remembreth not,
nor knoweth that hee hath seene the Charterparties or
copies thereof for the said voyage by the said shipps or any other
of the foure shipps interrogated. And otherwise cannot answer.

To the third hee saith the foresaid Captaine Wills went the foresaid
voyage (wherein this deponent was to make him the foresaid
allowance upon arbitation) in the yeare 1648, or thereabouts to the
Brazila, and that hee and his said brother were concerned therein
as part owners, and that some difference arising betweene his said brother
and the said Captaine upon his pretending to the average, the matter was
referred to arbitation, and the said 80 mill res awarded to the said Captaine
thereby. And otherwise hee cannot answer.

with the producent Christofer Boone, and that in the yeare
1654 the accompts betweene them was made up, and upon due
calculation thereof, the said Adrian Goldsmith was found to
be really indebted to the said Christofer Boone in the summe of
two hundred thousand Reals of plate, or silver money,
and that the said debt was contracted or owing for goods merchandizes and effects
formerly received by the said Adrian or his agents for his use and account

Mr Boone, and in consideration and for or towards satisfaction
thereof hee said hee would goe to a Notarie to make a

Mr Boones owne use) the severall quantities of silver and
Cochenille seized in England in the shipps Sampson,
Salvador and Saint George and which were or had bin claimed by
him the said Adrian in the Admiraltie Court at London,
and saith the said Transport was accordingly made in or about
the beginning of November 1654 (new stile)

Vandeput of this citie Marchant to claime for him, his silver
mentioned in the said schedule, which hee knoweth for that hee this

To the first Interrogatory hee sauth hee hath well knowne the shipp

that on or about the nineteenth day of November last past ffrench stile
the said shipp set saile and departed from the river of nantes
for Noirmonstier, there to take in her full lading and thence to saile for
London, and that hee this examinate was then Captaine and merchant of her.

To the second and third Interrogatories hee saith and deposeth that the
said shipp the said voyage ariving in the Roade of Noirmonstier
came to an anchor about a Cannon shot from shoare, in a place
where shipps frequently use to anchor and ride to receive advise from
the shoare. And at the same time there was a Biscayer or other
Spanish man of warr anchored in the same roade about halfe a cannon
shott from the ffortune, which when this deponent commander and
Merchant of the ffortune perceived, hee this examinate went ashore

his arivall, and get a more certaine knowledge of that man of

kinsman and partner and agent for him in his absence told this

lading her, the roade being open, and dangerous in respect of
pirates and enemies, one whereof (speaking of the said man of warr)
they said was then in the roade, and that but few dayes before the same
man of warr that was then there riding or some other like him
had boarded and plundred from a dutch shipp there in provisions,
sailes, cables and anchors, to the valew of foure hundred crownes,
and therefore hee said hee would not lade her there, but would have her removed and
brought into a more safe place to receive her lading and to that purpose hee
provided and sent a pilote along with this deponent in the boate
aboard the said shipp, soe to remove her.

To the fourth and fifth Interrogatorie sixth and seaventh Interrogatories
hee saith and deposeth that the said pilote soe sent aboard removed
the said shipp ffortune (after shee had laine about 4 howers at that
place and to such place where it was agreed betweene the said
pilot and Monsieur du daisné that shee should be in more safetie,
and lie more commodious for the taking in of her lading; and
in such removall the said pilot brought her upon a banck of
sands, whereon shee was speedily gott off againe, and then hee caried
her to such place which hee conceived to be safe for to ride in
but it proved for otherwise, for it was soe neere a ledge of
rocke, that when the sea fell away upon the ebb tide of ebb,
the weather being tempestuous (as hee saith it was) and the increasing
in stormines and the night being come, shee bilged upon the said
ledge of rock, and sunck in the sea, and was soe beaten and
opened that shee her rudder was broken off, and about fourteene
foote of her keele carried away and two or three of her plankes
neere the keele broken, and thereby and by her greate leakinesse
or opening upon such bilging, shee became full of water in hold
at upon every comming in of the tide, and shee became soe unserviceable
that without much repairing and amending her, shee was made unfit to proceede
againe to sea, having remained six or seaven dayes under water
(as every comming in of the tide) before they could know whether
shee could be saved and recov or not. And saith that in order
to her saving there were sometimes two, sometimes three or foure and sometimes
six five or six boates and 20 or twenty or five and twenty men
and sometimes more imployed about pumping and other work
about her for her weighing up, and saving, and that at greate
rates, some at 30 thirtie sols, some (namely the Carpenters)
at sixetie sols some and some at 55 sols and others at 45 sols
per day for their worke, which lasted which they were forced
to doe aswell by night as day (as the tide served) till shee
was weighed and brought into a place for her trimming, which
weighing and bringing her into such place lasted about seaven
or eight dayes, and it was three weekes or thereabouts before
shee was trimmed and fitted. The charge of which
weighing, repairing and fitting, together with materialls (occasioned
by the said bilging) hee saith amounted unto and cost this deponent,

her navigable, and fit to goe sea, and that shee was not thereby made soe

the said shipp, and said they would bot proceede further with her, whereupon
this deponent was constrained to come to a new composition with them
and the rest and to give them a monethes wages extraordinary and more than first
they were agreed with for.

To the last hee saith that the premisses soe happening, this deponent

them in, and saith the reason (as hee hath heard and beleeveth) why Pylotts doe
not goe off to shippe before they come soe neere is because shipps may came soe
neere, and safely anchor, and alsoe in respect of the danger of Turkish men
of warr who doe usually infest that coast, And saith that the sayd Jeggles

willfullnesse and default went empty thense, And saith that after a smale
tyme as aforesayd, shipps did unlade and relade at Mallega as
aforesayd, and soe might the sayd Browneing as hee beleeveth

declaring that if the carpenter and Gunner (which the said Whitfeild
and Edwards were) reported soe of her, they had noe reason to venture them=
selves in her. howbeit hee saith that hee cannot affirme such speeches
and behaviour of the said whitfeild and Edwards to be the cause of the
freighters giving over the voyage, for notwithstanding the same the
said shipp proceeded on the said voyage with the said goods from Saint Christofers
to goe to Montserrat where shee was to have taken in fiftie other tonnes of
goods of the Governour there for England, but in her course after three
times setting out shee proved soe leakie, that shee was faine to returne

got them laden in other shipps for England, all which hee knoweth

To the third article hee saith and deposeth during such time as the

mate and an other man endeavouring to stop a leake which shee had
sprung, the said whitfeild came and did chide and was much displeasd
with his mate for doing it without his order, telling him that if
they let her alone, shee might be hald ashore, as captaine
Brownes men had donne theirs and soe they might have had their
wages, which they were more likely (as they said) to have
by haling her ashore than by stopping her leakes or to that effect,
but the foresaid goods were taken out before this passage happened,
All which hee heard and saw. And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the 4th hee cannot depose, saving there happened a greate storme
while the said shipp was neere the Madera's in her homewards voyage.

To the fifth hee saith that the said voyage there was at New England
a good quantitie of corne put aboard the said shipp,
for the Madera's; amd in her course for the Maderas the said shipp
her bulkheads not being made fast, shee was in much perill of perishing,
and her men had much adoe to keep her free, but for any order given
to Whitfeild to have a care or looke to them, or any neglect of his therein
hee cannot depose, and

fixed at or against the said English shipps with intent to make the
sawe strike the sayle of shew, and that a sword being brandished upon the said English
shipp in manner of defiance, or that they would to their power defend
themselves, as is usually understood in such Cases, thereupon
the said Scroll tooke up a sword and brandishing the same said in dutch
theise words or the like in effect, Ick hebbe meé een sweerdt, ick
sal stracx bÿ ú comen, and soe by the said Scrolls order and direction

when they first espyed any strange shipps, and particularly when any of the
West-India shipps of the said United Netherlands came
neere them, they constantly carried the Middelborough Colours and
saith that that place being beyond the Line, upon occasion of such
meeting, if the said shipps the Mary and Unicorne had been
Spanish, they and the said other Dutch West India shipps
would in all probability, and according to common and usuall custome

verily beleeveth, That the 160 negroes or thereabouts in and on
board the said shipp Sarah at the time of her said surprizall, they
being designed for Viriginia or the Barbadoes, would have yeilded and
produced to the Owners 30 li sterling per head, or the worth thereof

with another for 27. hundred weight of sugar per head, each
hundred being there valewed at five and twenty shillings, which is
more then the summe of him predeposed, And further cannot depose
saving that the Negroes persons, which hee this deponent had soe procured
were all of them lusty young persons and soe hee intended to to

Thousand seaven hundred pounds sterling money of England, which
hee knoweth for that a sixteenth part of the said shipp before shee was
soe fitted and furnished to Sea upon the voiage aforesaid, of this deponents
certaine knowledge was by Richard hull the former Master and part
Owner thereof, sold unto the said Jeffereys and Colclough for one

shipp Sarah being about 70. persons, and being strictly ordered and
enjoyned by the said seizors to goe directly for England, upon paine of
forfeiture of the said shipp if they deviated or tooke any other Courses or voiages [XX]
would have required about thirty moneths time, but this deponent and the said
Arthur Perkins and the rest of the seized shipps Companies soe putt on board
the said shipp Sarah finding that such provisions were altogether insufficient
for such a Companie and voiage, and having but one entrie anchor, and one
peece of Cable of about 50. or 60. fathom, and one suite of sailes very
thin and insufficient for such a voiage, and being unwilling to expose their
lives to such imminent and almost inevitable danger, they sailed from
Cape de Lopes aforesaid to the Island of Saint Thomas, there they were
necessitated to sell the said shipp the Sarah for Victualls to keepe them
alive and to furnish another small Vessell, which they there procured to
carry them to the Barbadoes, there to gett passage for England, and saith

as they had in Virginia ready to be transported in the said shipp for
England, and which still does remaine thence to the great dammage and

the sayd shipp to sea in the King of Portugalls service on a warlike
designe and this deponent in her, and kept her in such service
four monethes, but before he so sent her out covenanted with the sayd
Hurdidge to give him six hundred millres per moneth so long as hee
should imploy the sayd shipp for her service, but saith he did not
performe his promise, but payd a good part of the sayd monthly pay
in salt att a very exorbitant price, so as the sayd Captaine Hurdidge
and his Owners in this Examinates judgment who was then upon
the place, did suffer damage by the sayd sayd salt the same being
forced upon him by the sayd Governour to the value of four hundred
millres or thereabouts. And otherwise hee ćannot depose.

To the fourth and fifth articles of the sayd allegation hee saith that the
sayd vessell in the sayd warlike service receyved some dammage
in her Rudder Irons, and otherwise, to a good value of this deponents
sight, the repaire whereof as Captaine Hurdidge told this deponent cost three
hundred millres and 20 dayes tyme to make good. and saith she ranne
[?Corne] to Angola laden with salt which was twenty dayes or thereabouts
in unlading of this deponents perfect remembrance, so as in case the

for the same by the sayd Governour. And further knoweth not.

To the sixth article. he saith the sayd ffrancis Hurdidge was imprisoned
att Angola as aforesayd. And this deponent heard him say that he
had a suite of law causelesly brought against him. and that thereby
and by his impriosnment suffered 300. millres dammage.

To the 7th. and 8th. articles. of the sayd allegation he saith that there
was left in the sayd shipp att Angola a quantity of salt which
was sayd to be 4000 Alquiers, and was putt upon the sayd Captaine
Hurdidge in stead of 800 millres for his freight in the Kings
service as aforesayd; and there were there likewise taken in
about 917. Negars for accompt of Portugall merchants, and
about 184 besides children for English Accompt videlicet the sayd Hurdidges Owners and Imployers besides
24. negars for this deponents accompt. all to be transported
to Bahia in Brasilia And the sayd ffrancis Hurdidge did
contract with the merchants laders for about three millres
and 600 res per head for each negar that
should be landed alive at Bahia, and there were about
seven hundred eighty seven Negars there safely landed for the
aććompt of the sayd Portugall merchants the freight of which
according to the rates aforesayd amounted to 3089. millres
or thereabouts, but the sayd Hurdidge forced this deponent
to pay four millres per head for the freight of his sayd negars.
And saith that the sayd shipp arrived at Bahia and landed her
sayd Negroes there about the seventh day of ffebruary 1650
English stile or 15. february 1651. new stile. and being so arrived the
very same day the sayd shipp freight and negars belonging
to the English with whatsoever else belonging to the English
were there seized by the Ministers of the King of Portugall
and amongst the rest two and twenty of this deponents sayd
Negers which were all landed alive there and about one hundred fifty nine negers
belonging to the sayd Hurdidge and his Owners and imployers and some four
negars belonging to some other of the sayd shipps mariners
all likewise there landed alive. And saith he observed that
most of the sayd Negars for English accompt were sold upwards
of fifty millres per head, and some upward of 60. millres
per head, so as hee saith hee doth verily beleive and doth estimate
that the sayd Negers for English Accompt were one with another
really worth forty five millres per head. so as the Negers
belonging to the sayd Hurdidge, his Owners and Imployers, so
landed and seized att the rates aforesayd were then of the
value arlate att the least. videlicet. seventhousand one hundred
fifty five millres, not aććompting this deponents sayd 22

the Kings Customes which he is to receive againe att Bahia
of the factors to whom the Negars are ćonsigned, and those Customes
doe arise to four millres per head for every peece of India
that is laden, and there were about 784 negars 917. Negars
laden att Angola for Portugall Aććcompt as aforesayd, but how many
peices of India the same did make he knoweth not ćertainly,
but by the proportion of his this deponents owne negers 24 of
which made 16 peeces of India, he ćonceyveth the sayd
917 negers might amount to about 700 peices of India so as
the Royall Customes due for the same might amount to two
thousand eight hundred millres or thereabouts, And he doth
beleive that the sayd Captaine Hurdidge did exther pay or give good
engagement to pay the sayd Customes before he ćame from
Angola, and was to have received the same att Bahia, but could
not so receyve the same, for that all things there belonging to the
English were seized upon as aforesayd. the premisses he deposeth

freight of all which together with the freight and averidge
of the sayd sugars so neere as this deponent ćan estimate the
same according to the publicke bills for freights and averidge
of goods sett forth att Bahia would and did amount to fourteene
thousand three hundred seventy five millres, the benefit
whereof had it not bene for the sayd seizure would have [?redounded]
to the Owners of the sayd shipp. And further deposeth not.

To the 12th article he saith that whilst the sayd shipp lay att Bahia
as aforesayd there was of this deponents sight faire plenty of sugar and so few shipps to transport
it that severall persons who had hired tonnage in the sayd shipp off
and from the Provador or Governour of Bahia did lett out their
sayd tonnage so hired to others and receyved two millres for the
place of each Chest in the tonnage so lett which benefit might
possibly have come to the sayd ffrancis Hurdidge in case he had had

sold them and they likewise seized and tooke from this
deponent five large Elephants teeth well worth and that

which this deponents dead losse did and doe amount to one
thousand and sixteene millres, which att the rates of sugars
there att that tyme would have produced six and
thirty Chests of the best white sugars; And saith moreover
