paymente of the reste, this examinate & the reste of the partners ioyntly firmed to a
bill made by Captaine ffurtho as he thinketh & delivered the same as theire
deede to the said Stratford /
To the second article he sayth truth yt ys that Howe by the consente of this examinate
and the reste of the gouldsmithes aforesaid did make the price with the said Stratford
for the said pearle, & not otherwise
To the third he sayth that Howe did not challendge eany further intereste in the

did, and this examinate affirmethe that he & the reste were as carefull in the buyenge
& conveyenge of the said goodes to lande as the said Howe was And more to this
article hee cannot depose
To the iiijᵗʰ he sayth most truth yt ys that after this examinate was examined in Pli¬
mouth he came into winters garden to certify howe what he had don, and
soe sone as the said howe sawe this examinate he vsed theise speeches in
greate rage swearinge a greate oathe Thow hast vndon vs all, and hast
I thincke taken a pece of money to betray vs, & sayd he would rather
haue byn torne in peeces, then confessed the matter, And this examinate cannot
deny but he confessed that ffurtho & the said howe were the men that
had boughte Captaine Stratfords pearles Notwithstandinge he saythe
that confession was made with consente of Howe & the reste of the partners
to lay all the faulte on howe because this examinate & the reste mighte haue
theire liberty, howe beinge fled with the goodes
To the vᵗʰ he cannot depose of his owne knowledge for that he was not called

pearles
To the vjᵗʰ he sayth he herde howe say & proteste since he gott the
pearles into his handes that he mente to deale honestly and well in the
devition of the pearle with this examinate & the reste of the partners, & that he
would deliver a true accompte of them And more he cannot depose Savinge
he sayth that yesterday being the xvᵗʰ of this instante Aprill 1594 the said

as he receaved them he was contented to acknowledge Sedwicke for
partner
To the vijᵗʰ he sayth true yt ys that Captaine ffurtho shewed to this examinate in his
chamber a bagge with silver & goulde, but howe much was in the same he knoweth

Busshoppesgate streete, & there in presence of Thomas marshall willed this examinate
to reste contented, for he mente to make him partner with him in the bargaine
& to suffer him deale with Sedgewicke & ffurtho as he coulde Sayenge what
reason ys yt that they should be partners with him : And he never knewe or
hearde vntill nowe of late, but that yt was mente by all the partners that
ffurtho should haue his parte of the bargaine soo farre further as his
money extended
