the sayd Grove sent to helpe him could and did lade aboard the sayd
shipp only one hundred and twenty kintalls of the sayd three hundred
Kintalls of ffish whereas if the sayd Wood had had more helpe
on shoare to assiste in ladeing the sayd ffish aboard and that the rest of the
shipps Company had not bin hindred from goeing a shoare to assiste
therein by the sayd Groves employing them to pick Okum the whole three

in a milde manner desyre and entreate the sayed Grove not doe as hee
had

had threatned but to suffer the sayd boate to be laden with salt and
told him what a great disparagement it would be to him the sayd
Wood in his treade there if the sayd boate or the men aboard her
should be wronged whereupon the sayd Grove in an outragious manner
reviled the sayd Wood and called him old Roague and old Pedler
and old Pimpe and other the like disgracefull names and told him
the sayd Wood that if hee were not an old roague hee would drubb
him And alsoe sayd (speaking to the sayd Woods) you old roague yo:u
were in the hold the other day but if ever I see you in hold againe
I will trice you up with a tackle or hee spake other menaceing speeches

other passages were soe done spoken on the open deck in presence
and heareing of this deponent and the Boatswaine and most of the sayd
shipps company And further hee deposeth not./

To the 13th article hee saith that imediately after the sayd Grove
had soe threatned and reviled the sayd Wood, hee the sayd
Woods did in a civill and mylde manner demand of the sayd
Grove why he would not lett him have any salt from on board
and the sayd Grove replyed and sayd that the shipp wanted
stiffneing or ballast whereto the sayd Wood answered and sayd
to the sayd Grove why then did yow not a day agoe send for
more stones whereto the sayd Grove replyed and sayd hee had forgott
it and the sayd Woods then asked the sayd Grove what hee would doe
when he had more stones aboard whereto the sayd Grove replyed
and sayd that then hee would carry them on shoare againe And
these speeches passed betwixt the sayd Grove and Woods publiquely
upon the deck in presence and hearing of this deponent and most of
the shipps Company the sayd Wood speakeing soe loude and with
such rage and fury that people who stood on shoare stood gazeing
and wondering to see and heare such words and behaviour proceede
from a Master of a shipp to his Supracargoe./

with the forementioned words and actions of the sayd Grove went on
shoare leaving the arlate William Tizard one of the Mates of the
shipp aboard with the sayd Grove the master, and this deponent
went a shoare with the sayd Woods and therefore knoweth not what
words passed aboard then betwixt the sayd Tizard and Grove, but hath
heard the sayd Grove at severall other tymes (speakeing of the sayd
Tizard and this deponent and most of the Officers of the shipp who were
all hyred by the sayd Woods) in an angrie manner sayd that there was a knott of them
but hee would breake them And hee saith that while this deponent
was soe on shoare with the sayd Woods the sayd Tizard came on
shoare and brought a noate from the sayd Grove and delivered the
same to the sayd Woods which noate the sayd Woods was before this

sayd noate soe seemed to be very glad thereof and sent this deponent to Mr Ellet
and Mr Pardon and Robert Rogers and Captaine Reynolds and others Who were by contract
to have salt from aboard the sayd shipp and desyred them to send
their boates aboard the sayd shipp for the salt which the sayd Woods had
sould unto them whereto the sayd people replyed that the divell should have
him before they would goe againe to receave salt from aboard him yet
notwithstanding the fishing tyme being almost spent and they being in great
want of salt they sent their boates againe aboard the sayd shipp for
salt and demanded the same but the sayd Grove would not permitt
them to receave any salt from aboard the sayd shipp by which meanes
the sayd Wood began to loose his reputation in the
sale of his salt and was discharged amongst those to whome hee
had sold it whereas hee neede not soe to have bin for that there was

Luke Woods at Newfound land provided to be laden aboard the Peace by way
of the fowle and foggie weather, (it being very preiudiciall to lade fish
aboard a shipp there unlesse in fayre and cleare weather) could not be laden And saith that upon
the fifteenth day of August 1657 the weather proveing fayre and very fitt
and convenient to lade fish aboard in, the arlate Luke Wood and Mr Tizard
called early in the morning for the marriners of the Peace who were
aboarde (there being then ashoare only about tenn or twelve Mariners of her company
who constantly continewed a shoare there to helpe to prepare fish in a
readinesse to be laden aboard) to come on shoare with their boats

aboard and imployed them to pick Okum for

both out upon the deck and the sayd Grove seemed to bee much

boates till hee gott more ballast aboard And the sayd Woods
desyring the sayd Grove in a mild manner that hee would lett
the sayd boates be laden with salt and told him it would be a

would drubb him and further speaking to the sayd Wood sayd You old
roague you were in the hould the other day but if ever I see you in
the hould againe I will hoist or trice you up with a tackle And
the sayd Woods still desyreing the sayd Grove that the sayd boates
might be laden with salt the sayd Grove answered that his shipp
wanted stiffening or ballast and therefore it should not bee delivered
whereto the sayd Woods replyed and sayd Why had not you then sent
for stones before, and the sayd Grove thereto answered and sayd
What if I had forgott it must I  be tyed to a day, whereupon
the sayd Woods speaking to the sayd Grove sayd what will you doe
then when you have more stones on board whereto the sayd Grove
answered and sayd then hee would carry them on shoare againe
all which words or others to the like effect passed upon the open
deck of the Peace in presence of this deponent and severall others
of the sayd shipps company: And hee this deponent heard severa;;
of the Inhabitants of Newfounnd land who (as they sayd) heard the

was the matter, and marvailed much to hear such
words passe and be used by a Master of a shipp to his Supra=

Grove went on shoare and left the arlate William Tizard

To the 5th and 6th articles of the sayd libell hee saith that the sayd shipp
Peace being departed from Gravesend and in her course towards ffrance was
by Contrary windes put into ffalmouth where shee lay winde bound
about twelve or thirteene dayes and about the seaventeenth of Aprill
1657 the winde came fayre and the arlate Woods and Thomas Grove and this
deponent and others of the sayd shipps company being then on shoare
the sayd Woods in presence of this deponent as hee remembreth of and others of the shipps company
did speake to the sayd Thomas Grove and desyre him to goe presently aboard
for that the winde was then fayre to sett sayle and the season of the yeare
somewhat spent the shipp being to stay in ffrance to take in her ladeing
of salt and therefore desyred the sayd Grove to make haste aboard and
sett sayle and prosecute the shipps intended voyage And saith hee well
knoweth the sayd Grove and Wood did about two a clock in the afternoone
that day goe aboard the sayd shipp togeather, and as soon as they
came aboard sent the sayd shipps boate ashoare with some of her
Company in it to cleere the sayd shipp at the Castle, and in the
meane tyme brought the sayd shipp to sayle, And saith that this being
done and a Country boate lyeing by the sayd shipps side, the sayd
Thomas Grove the Master would needes goe againe on shoare
therein, and Commanded his Mastes that when they came neere the
Castle they should bring the sayd shipp to an Anchor againe, And
hee ffurther saith that the sayd Woods being given to understand by
some of the shipp that the sayd Master was goeing on shoare againe
did come out upon the deck and in presence of this deponent and most
of the sayd shipps company did earnestly entreat and perswade the
sayd Master not to goe on shoare againe, and told him that his
goeing ashoare would be a great hinderance to the sayd shipps voyage
being bound upon a fishing designe, all which entreaties not
withstanding the sayd Thomas Grove (hee saith) did goe on shoare
in the sayd Country boate, and there stayed on shoare most part
of that night (the winde being still fayre) and
about two a clock in the morning came againe aboard, being
then (in this deponents Judgement and observation) much [?overtaken] in
drinke
~~~
HCA 13/73 f.12r Annotate
drinke and being aboard began to curse and sweare and
sayd that there were some on board that thought much of
his being a shoare And saith that the sayd Thomas Grove
about an hower after hee soe came aboard (his hasty and
angrie humour  being over) did give order to weigh Anchor
and did sett sayle upon the voyage in question And further to
those articles hee cannot depose./

To the 7th hee cannot depose./

To the 8th hee cannot depose not being present When the sayd Grove
spake any such words at L[?azeras] as is arlate, but saith hee hath

land while the shipp lay there in the harbour of Saint Johns./

To the 9th hee saith hee was not present when the arlate Luke Woods
gave order to bring the wines and Brandy on shoare for the Governour
of Newfound land but heard the sayd Woods afterwards saye that hee
had given order for the bringing them on shoare and heard the sayd Wood
find fault with the sayd Grove the Master for not sending them on
shoare, and knoweth that the sayd Grove the Master did goe on shoare with
the shipps boate at Newfound land and carry therein goods of his owne
and a quantitie of bread before this deponent heard the sayd Wood finde
fault with the sayd Grove for not sending the sayd wines and Brandy
on shoare according to his order And further hee cannot depose

To the 10th and 11th articles hee saith that in the beginning of the moneth
of August 1657 while the shipp Peace remayned at Newfound land to take
in her ladeing of ffish there happened fowle and rayny weather for severall
dayes soe that by reason thereof diverse Kintalls of fish which the arlate
Luke Woods had provided to be laden aboard the sayd shipp could not
for want of fayre weather to lade it in, be put aboard the sayd shipp,
and this deponent being then aboard well remembreth that about
the fifteenth day of that moneth the weather happened to be very fayre
and fitt for ladeing the sayd fish, and therefore the sayd Woods and the arlate
Tizard seeing it soe to be, called warly in the morning that day for the
Mariners of the Peace to come on shoare to assiste in ladeing the
fish soe provided, on board, while the weather was fayre, And saith
that the sayd Grove the Master did send only sixe men on shoare to
assiste the sayd Wood in ladeing the sayd ffish and kept the rest of the
shipps company (save some few that were on shoare before) on
shipp board, and this deponent after those six men were gone on shoare
went alsoe on shoare to trimme and mend Casks as hee this deponent
used to doe other dayes And saith that hee this deponent being on
shoare saw the sayd Grove the Master and Robert Grove and Thomas
Yeomans two of his Mates come that day with the shipps longe
boate and therewith turne to the windeward and sayle up and downe
(in the harbour for their pleasure and recreation by the space of
three or fower howers coming sometymes neere the place where
the

the sayd Woods and those few of the shipps Company that were sent
to assiste him were fitting the said ffish to goe on board and then
turne about with the longboate to the windewards againe without
offereing their helpe and assistance in ffitting the sayd fish  to be carried
on board And further hee cannot depose not knowing how the sayd
Grove the Master imployed those of the shipps company who remayned
aboard whether in picking Okum or otherwise nor heard what
words passed betwixt the sayd Woods and the sayd master touching his
sending soe few on shoare to helpe to lade the sayd ffish./

To the 12th and 13th articles hee saith that about the one and twentith
day of August 1657 arlate the arlate Luke Woods having bin on shoare
in Newfound land came aboard the Peace with a shallop and brought
with him two boates to fetch salt from aboard her which some
persons on shoare had bought of him, and being come on board
asked the Boatswaine for the sayd Grove the Master, and the Boatswaine
anwered and sayd hee was in his Cabbin, and (as this deponent beleeveth
by the ensueing passages) the sayd Woods there desyred him to give order to his company
to deliver to the sayd boates their ladeings of salt, And saith the
sayd Grove the Master in a great rage came out of his Cabbin and
rann upon the deck, and swore that hee would sinke that boate that
should come there for any salt and the sayd Woods seeing him in such
a rage and furie followed him upon the deck and in a mild manner
entreated and perswaded him to deliver the sayd salt to the sayd
baotes and told him it would bee a great discredit to him the sayd
Wiid in his trade at Newfound land if the sayd boates or the
men on board them should be wronged, and the salt not delivered
whereat the sayd Grove the Master was more enraged and called
the sayd Woods Old Roague and other reproachfull bnames and
holding up his fist to the sayd Woods face sayd thus or the like
in effect if you (speaking to the sayd Woods) were not an old Roague
I would drubb you and further sayd (speaking to the sayd Woods)
you old Roague you were in the hold the other day but if ever I
see you in hold againe I will hoyst you up with a tackle, or words
to the like effect And all those words and passages hee saith were
soe done and spoken upon the open deck in presence of this deponent
and the Boatswaine and others of the sayd shipps Company and was
spoken by the sayd Master in such a lowde and outragio[us GUTTER]
manner that after this deponent went a shoare severall people whoe were
on shoare told this deponent that they were amazed to see and
heare as they stood on shoare such uncivill behaviour and words
given by one that was Master of a shipp to one that was his
Merchant or Supracargo and an anchient man, And further

To the 14th hee saith hee well remembreth that soone after the sayd
uncivill words and carriage of the sayd Grove the Master, the sayd

any such noate were sent or noe./

To the 15th article hee saith that not longe after videlicet either that day or
the next day the sayd boates came againe to the side of the Peace
and their companyes demanded of the sayd Grove the Master their sayd
boates loades of salt as sent for the same by tthe sayd Woods,
and well knoweth that the sayd Grove the Master then also refused
to deliver any salt unto them and sent them away emptie
though the sayd shipp had then aboard her of this deponents
knowledge a great quantitie both of ffish and salt and
stones beside store of provisions and rodd then
in the harbour of Saint Johns in Newfound land which is a
very good harbour And hee this deponent verily beleeveth
that the sayd Grove the master by his peverse and disobedient
carriage both there and at other places during the voyage in question
did plainly demonstrate that hee hade an intereste to
overthrowe the sayd shipps voyage and soe in deede hee did
thereby overthrowe the same And further to this article hee

from Newfound land to the Barbados and bearing up to them they
found that the shipp they came up with was a shipp that came from
Nantes in ffrance in Company of the Peace, And saith that the
arlate Luke Woods did (but by whose perswasion hee knoweth not)
goe accompanied with Robert Grove one of the Mates of the Peace
aboard the sayd shipp which came from Nantes as aforesayd,
and when they were aboard her sent the boate of the Peace back
againe aboard her, and it being come the sayd Thomas Grove
the Master of the Peace caused the sayd shipp Peace to stand
away about halfe a league from the sayd other shipp on which
the sayd Woods was on board, and Commanded her to tack and
stand to the Winde wards of the sayd other shipp And although the
Boatswaine and Gunner of the Peace who were both experienced
Seamen told the sayd Grove that if hee held on that course hee
would

the course, but hold on the same course and soe [?ranne] with the Peace aboard the sayd other
shipp on board which the sayd Woods was, and rann her in the quarter
with that violence, that hee thereby much endangered the losse of both
the sayd shipps, in soemuch that the ffrench men aboard the sayd other
shipp seeing the danger they were in, rann out of the sayd ffrench
shipp aboard the Peace to save them selves, and lost the sayd Woods

To the third 4 and 5th articles hee saith and deposeth that in the moneth of June last

the same were at the Canaries to be by the said John Maria Basso and
Jeronimo Basso invested in logwood (as this deponent was informed by

of ligorne and the loading to belong to Italians, the said factors procured

should be made by the officers of the place according to custome, and
saith the Al?colder or officer ordered this deponent to goe and remaine
aboard till such visitation were made, telling this deponent that soe
it must be, for that they had  had information that not longe before there
had bin greate sicknes in Italy, and soe this deponent went aboard
accordingly, And further deposeth not, saving hee went that time ashore
in the boate of a dutch shipp that was riding neere the Lisbone frigot,
And saith that two dayes after this deponents said retourne aboard
the officers came to the sea side and sent aboard the said shipp the
Lisbone frigot (then there riding by the name of the Saint Anthony of
Padua), to have her bills of health and dispatches brought ashore
to them to the end that they having visited them, the said shipp
might proceed to her pratique or trade, and at this comming of the
said officers, the said John maria Basso the next day before their

with the said dispatches and bring the masters mate, pilot, chiurgion
and boatswaine with him, and one of the shipps company putting
it into the said Bartholomew ketchers his h?ead that this was some
trick to get them ashore and betray them, and
saying that if noe hurt was intended the merchant would have
written to the said ketcher from shore, and therewithall the said
ketcher and company began to weigh as if they would  begonne,

the same day towards evening, they from shore seeing the said shipp
preparing to saile, sent a boate aboard againe with a white cloth
or flagge, and the clarke of the examinations in the said boate, who
asked this deponent the reason thez came not ashore being sent for,
to which the said ketcher bidd or ordered this deponent to answer

ashore suffice that this deponent brought only two of the officers

to stand out to sea, but the next morning hee would come there againe

To the 13th hee saith that at first it was demanded that the master (which
they alwaies understood to be this deponent) and the other officers by him before mentioned
should according to custome come ashore, but afterwards the said marchant John
Maria Basso (perceiving them backwards) sent this deponent a letter advising
that if hee only came with any two of his mariners ashore it should
serve [?twice], for soe hee had prepared the busines with the officers there, and
otherwise negatively.

To the 14th hee saith that the said ketcher not being there taken notice
of at all to be master, was never required to come ashore, but it was
this deponent was looked upon as master and was invited ashore as aforesaid,
and this deponent holds it fit and lawfull to goe ashore with the officers
aforesaid where the custome requires it if they receive pratique, though
in an enemies countrey, whether way is soe made that they come not
as enemies but as friends as here it was, And otherwise hee cannot
answer saving as aforesaid.

To the 15th hee saith that there were the Capitan del mara and
a master da Campo and five or six persons more in the boate
with the said John Maria Basso when hee came soe aboard
as aforesaid, and the reason whie this deponent went not ashore with
them in their boate, was because pratique not being grannted, they
could not receive him aboard as aforesaid, and hee the said Basso
[?directly] exhorted them to come ashore and told them they should surely
have pratique, but showed not any order or license, it being frivolous
to imagine hee should, till they had bin ashore and satisfied the officers
touching their health and otherwise according to the custome of the place.

To the 17 hee saith that if the said ketcher had donn and suffered to be
donne what hee might with safetie have donne, the outwards lading had
undoubtedly bin delivered at Oratava, and pratique there obtained,
but soe farr was hee from furthering it, that at last when this deponent
perswaded him that this deponent and two men might goe ashore, the
said ketcher said it was impossible, and indeed did not doe his best
endeavour, and that it was his fault that the busines miscarried, for
they might there have traded favourably.

To the 19 hee saith hee conceiveth John Maria Basso to be of fourtie
yeares of age or thereabouts, and of grizled haire videlicet partly white and
partly black, but his stature hee cannot declare for hee saw him only sitting
in the boate and not upon his feete, and hee knew him to be hee, for that
hee brought and showed this deponent the same letter that this deponent
left ashore for him at the first time of this deponents going ashore as
foresaid, and gave the said letter back againe. And otherwise referred himselfe
to his foregoeing deposition and saving the same cannot answer.

Examined on the said Allegation:

Rp. 2:dne

Robert Grove of Wapping Mariner aged
50 yeeres or thereabouts sworne and Examined.

To the first article if the said Allegation hee saith and deposeth That
the arlate Ship the Peace whereof Thomas Grove was Master
was of this deponents certaine Knowledge bound from the
Newfoundland as well to the Leeward Islands as to the
Barbadoes. and soe much hee saith hee oftentimes heard
Luke Wood (in his lifetime) on board the said ship. acknowledge
and declare, and further hee cannot depose:/:

To the second hee saith that the said Ship lay winde bound
at ffalmouth Harbour on her outward Voyage for about thirteen
dayes, and soe soone as ever the winde Turned. The said
Thomas Grove, and Luke Wood (who were then both on shore)
did come Imediately on board the said Ship Peace, and soe
soone as they were come onboard which their coming onboard was in the afternnoone of the 17th of Aprill 1657: the said Grove ordered
that the Anchor should be weighed, and that the ship
should be sailed downe to Pendennis Castle (being
about two Miles from ffalmouth Harbour) and there ordered
this deponent (who was Cheife mate of the said Ship. all the said Voyage to lye there at
Anchor untill day light, in regard it is a very dangerous place
(for~~~

HCA 13/73 f.116v Annotate
for Rocks, and Shelves; and saith that the said Grove
after hee had Given the said order to this deponent did
the same day goe on shore about some busines, in a Country
boate, (because hee would not hinder the said Ship
in taking his owne boate,) and about one or two
of the Clock in the next morning did come onboard
the said Ship Peace, and the Morning beginning to be light
the said Grove ordered his Anchor to be weighed
Imediately, and soe sailed from thence, And saith
that the said Grove did not doe any prejudice
to the said Voyage by any stay of his either at ffalmouth
or Pendennis Castle or places Adjacent, and further
cannot depose:/:

To the 3th hee saith that from Pendennis Castle the said
Grove sailed the said Ship to the River of Nants
where shee tooke in the Lading of Salt and saith
the said Grove did not refuse to receive or take on
board the said Ship, any salt that was sent to the
said Ship, untill such time as the said Ship was fully
laden, and soe full that shee could not with safety
beare more, because shee drew about thirteene
ffoote water at her Sterne, and about Eleaven foot
and halfe at her head, And saith shee was laden
about three Inches above her Lading marke.
which is not usually done, neither ought shee to be laden
above her Loading marke. And further saith that
before the said Grove did turne back any boates
Lading of salt, hee the said Grove did send a Noate
by One of his Company to the said Luke Wood, /who
was on shore,) that hee could not take in noe more
Salt, because the said Ship was fully Laden already
or to that effect, And saith that Besides the
said salt which was Laden onboard the said Ship, the
said Luke Wood had severall goods on board
the said Ship, namely. about thirty Quoyles of Rope
two Great Trunks, severall Quarter Caskes with [XXX GUTTER]
and Oyle, and barrells of Pitch and Tarre, and some
other Things which were for the said Woods owne Private Trade
and account, which said Goods did as hee beleeveth hinder
the Lading of Tenne Tonne of Salt, on board the said
Ship, for had not they bin on board her, she would
well have Carried and borne tenne Tonns more
And saith that the said Ship being soe fully Laden as
aforesaid. was the only Cause that the said Grove did
refuse to take more Salt on board the said Ship, And
if the said Grove had taken more Salt on board it [would GUTTER]
(have

have very much endangered the founding and sinking
of the said Ship, and the losse of her lading, and men on
board her: And saith that on the said Ship Passage from
ffrance with her said Lading of salt to Newfoundland hee
this deponent did heare the said Wood say and declare that
the said Ship was Laden Deep Enough, The Premisses
hee deposeth being Cheife Mate of the said Shipp
and helping to take in and lade the said salt, and tooke notice
of the Premisses: And further hee cannot depose:/:

To the 4.th hee saith that at all the times that the said Ship
was receiving and taking in her lading of ffish at
Newfound Land the said Luke Wood had all the
Mariners of the said Ship (but three or foure.) on shore:
and saith that those which were kept on board by the said Grove
at the severall times of the sending fish on board at Newfound
-land were kept to looke to the said Ship and to receive and
stowe the said ffish on board the said Ship, and to Deliver out
the Salt from on board the said Ship, And saith that this
deponent (when hee was on shore with the said Luke Wood)
did see and hear many of the Inhabitants, of Newfoundland
laugh and mock at this deponent and the said Luke Wood
and the rest of the shipps Crewe that were on shore; for
being soe many of them on shore to make up and
send ffish on board the said Ship; and leaveing their ship
with soe few men on board her: And saith that the said
Luke Wood did send some fish on board the said ship in the
mornings before the sunne rysinge and in the Evenings when the dewe was
on the Ground, which hee should not have done, and saith
that some of the fish which the said Wood sent on board
was soe rotten that it fell and broke into peeces, as
the same was handed into the said Ship; which said Rotten
ffish, and that which was sent on board when the Dewe
was on the Ground, did very much prejudice, and damage
the other which was laden in the said Ship; And
further hee cannot depose:/.

To the ffifth hee saith that on or about the 21th of August
1657: in the morning the said Luke Wood did come on board
the said Ship, and saith that this deponent was on board the
said Ship, when the said Luke Wood came on board
her, and did not heare the said Grove Threaten
the said Wood to hoyse him upp with the Tackling, or doe
any Mischeife to him: neither did hee heare the said
Grove threatened to sinke the boate wherein the said
Wood came to the said Ships side, but saith that the said
Grove did refuse to let the said Salt goe out of the said
Ship at that present time; telling the said Wood. that if the
(same

same was Delivered out of the said Ship, shee
would want stiffening, but desired the said Wood
to stay a little space untill hee Gott stones to stiffen
and ballast the sd ship to keepe her streight and
right, and Imediately the said Grove sent some of his Company
in the Ships Boate to get Stones to the said Ships side, and as
the same were receiving onboard. others of the
said Ships Company at the same time, and in the
afternoone of the said 21th of August. 1656 [CSG: CHECK THIS YEAR, SINCE SHOULD BE 1657]: delivered
out to the said Wood a Boate, or two boates Lading
of salt. And saith that it would have been very dangeros
for the said Grove to have delivered out the said
salt without first receiving stones of other heavy
things on board her, to ballast her, and keepe
her stiffe, for that thereby shee might be over
set, And further saith that the said Wood at other
times sent Boates soe fast that the said Grove and
the marine:rs on board her had not time to fetch
stones to stiffen the said Ship; And saith the said Wood
did as aforesaid Imploy most of the said Ships
Company on shore; soe that the said Grove had not
men sufficient to fetch stones to ballast and stiffen y:e
said Ship, And further that a Ships Lading
of salt is, and may be sooner delivered out of a
shup, then Boates can goe on shore and fetch
stoned, The Premisses hee deposeth being Mate

To the 7th hee saith that the said Luke Wood (being ashore
did send one Tizard that was one of the Mates of the
said Ship onboard her to the said Grove (who was then
on board the said Ship). to desire him the said Grove
to send all this the said Woods Coyles of Ropes on shore, But the
said Ropes being upon the private account of the said
Wood and the said Grove not knowing the weight
thereof, did forbeare the delivery of them, and the said
Tizard goeing ashore and acquainting the said Wood
therewith. the said Wood came on board the sayd ship and ?gave ?the
said Grove the Invoice of the same and of the weight thereof upon sight whereof
the said Grove did Imediately cause the same to be put on
a Boate or Boates, and sent the same onshore; and did
not hinder the said Wood any way in the disposall thereof
The premisses hee deposeth being on board the said Ship and ?seeing
and taking notice of the Premisses. And further cannot depose./

HCA 13/73 f.118r Annotate
To the 8th hee saith that as the said ship was goeing from
Newfoundland towards the Barbadoes, they espeyed a vessell
(which afterwards appeared to be a ffrench vessell) and the said
Wood having a desyre to goe aboard of the said vessell, did
desire the said Grove to let the ships Boate be Hoysted out
that he might goe on board of the said Vessell, which was
accordingly done, and this deponent went in the
said Boate with the said Wood on board the said Vessell, and after the said
Wood and this deponent had bin on board her about an
houre the said Wood came up towards the said Vessell
and by Casualty came on board her, which was occasioned only by the said
ship the Peace her steering badly, and keeping her
helme a Lea, upon on Tack, and hard a weather on
her other Tack, as hee verily beleeveth And saith
that there was little damage done to the said ffrench Vessell, by
the Peace her Coming foule upon her neither did the
said Luke Wood suffer any prejudice therby. and further
hee cannot depose./:

To the 9th hee saith and Deposeth that by meanes of Contrary
windes, and Calmes, and hurricanoes (which were very
frequent then there insoemuch that neither the said Grove
nor this deponent nor the other mates on board her could
gaine the Latitude) The said ship did misse the Island
of the Barbadoes, And not by the Willfullnes Ignorance
or Carlessnes of the said Thomas Grove; And after
the said Grove did perceive that the said Ship had
missed the Barbadoes, hee told the said Wood (in the
presence of this deponent and others of the said Ships Company)
that hee would beate it up againe (meaning the Barbadoes)
and the said Grove did endeavour
to saile to the Barbadoes, and hee haveing spent
about Eighteene houres thereabout, (after they perceived that
they had missed it,) The said Luke Wood, in this deponents
presence gave the said Grove speciall order to saile the
said ship to Martinice, and from thence to Mevis, which the
said Grove accordingly did; And saith that hee verily
beleeveth that the said Grove would have Got to the
Barbadoes with the said Ship, in (about) tenne Dayes
of time, after hee perceived it was missed, if the said
Wood would have sufferred him soe to doe, and not
have ordered him to leave off his Endeavouring and saile
to Martinice and soe to Mevis, And saith that all the

mates thereabout, and saith about three dayes or ?some before
the said Grove Discovered the Island called Santo
Lazio (by which sight of which Island the said Grove
and Company perceived they had overshot the Barbadoes)
the said Grove called this deponent and his other mates
to an accompt of the said ships sailing, and asked
them howe farr the said ship, was to windward
of the Barbadoes by their account, or to that effect,
to which this deponent made answer that by his Account
she was about 140 Leages (sic) to windward of the Barbadoes. And the said Yeomans
made answer as hee now remembreth that by his Account the said ship was
about one hundred and twenty Leagues to windwards of the Barbadoes and the said Hyzard
said that by his account (as this Deponent now remembreth)
shee was above a hundred Leagues to windward
of the Barbadoes or to that effect, And the said
Grove told this deponent and his said other mates, that
by his account hee was alsoe above one hundred Leagues
to Windward of the Barbadoes. And saith
that the Course which the said Grove steered (by his
the said Groves owne Account, and by the account of
his mates) was above one hundred leagues to windward
of the Barbadoes when as afterwards shee really appeared
then to be to Leeward of the Barbadoes; And
further deposeth that the foresaid Tizard who was
hyred by the said Woods to goe one of the Mates

English ship, did stay at Nevis and Saint Christophers about
three monethes to receave in a Lading of goods there
but at Length came away from thence for London a great Part dead
ffreighted, And the reason was for that the Hurricanoes and stormes

with his said ffish: And saith that hee this deponent
is very well versed in the nature, and Quality of
Barbadoes Sugar, and Nevis sugar and therby knoweth
that a pound of Nevis sugar is well worth two pounds
of the Barbadoes sugar; in regard Nevis sugar is a
great deale better Cured or dryed: And saith that
all such damage which happend to the said fish which the
said Luke Wood Laded on board the said ship at Newfound
-Land (saving the small damage which came by the said Oyle
running downe as aforesaid came and happened by
the said Luke Wood Lading of the said ffish on board the said Ship

about a Moneth or five weekes, before the said Wood

the market there and did much hinder the sale of the
said ffish brought thither in the Peace And saith that when
the said ship Peace did arrive at Nevis there was
there, and alsoe at Saint Christophers great want of Provisions
Espetially of ffish, and if the said Wood would have sent up

over, and then retourne to the same place where they leave their cables and
anchors soe slipped, to which they use (before going out) to fasten a buoy or buoys
(as the Alexander now did) to finde the same by againe. And many shipps
at a time being often necessitated soe to put out and leave their cables and
anchors, they usually upon retourne after the storme goe to their owne cables
and anchors, and not meddle with those of other shipps that are not yet
retourned, well knowing that the shipps to which they belong will certainly

the Alexander, the said Colquite himselfe cut
the towe to which the said buoy was fastened, and soe leaving the said cables

and [?spe] the said two cables and anchors were and
are lost, which hee knoweth seeing the premisses, and helping (by command
of the said Colquite) to fasten the desire to the said shipp-buoy of the
Alexander, and afterwards seeing the said Colquite cut the tow in two
by which meanes the said cables sinking

And further deposeth not.

To the last hee saith the Commissioners for prize goods have provided
him of lodging, and gave him now and then a shilling, to beare his charges,
which hee himselfe desyreth, and not otherwise nor gave him any clothes

John Stannian of London gentleman aged 26 yeeres
or thereabouts sworne and examined.

To the first and second articles of the said allegation hee saith and deposeth
that in or about May last was a twelve moneth the Governour and
Company of English Merchants trading to East India sent out and employed
from this Port in Merchant service two shipps the one named the Advise
Robert May commander, and the other named the dragon Nicholas
Baddiford commander to goe and saile for Bantam in the Island
of Java Major, and that in or about the said moneth of May 1658
the said Companies factors having received their Commissions, and the said shipps
their dispatches they set saile from the downes and arrived with their money and goods of
a greate valew for the said companies account, to be dischardged at
Bantam, and there to be reladed for England, All which hee knoweth
for that hee was privie to the giving of the said Commissions and
dispatches, and having seene the Charterpartie of the said affreightance
and being acquainted with all the transactions touching the said shipps.

To the third fourth and rest of the articles of the said allegation
hee saith and deposeth that according to advises and dispatches for
the factors and commanders of the said two shipps sent to the said
English Company and others (which this deponent hath seene) the shipp the
Advise arived at Anjar neare Bantam on or about the 15th of
October 1658, and that on or about the seaventeenth of the said moneth
a Pr[?aw] was sent off from the English house under command of
one Peter Corke with fresh provisions to be caried aboard her
but fearing himselfe to goe aboard in regard of certaine dutch shipps
which were there riding, hee sent off a canow or boate with an
English flagg and two of the companies servants aboard one of the
dutch shipps to know whither the pra[?w] might come aboard the Adrian
but the dutch carrying them selves most insolently towards the English servants
the said Canow and kept the same and the servants and flagg, and
would not nor did suffer that the said shipp should receive the Provisions
nor did they send warning to the Pra[?w] to depart, And that on or
about the eighteenth day of the said moneth of October, the said shipp
Advise arived by the Commander of the dutch ffleete under Pull[?apanjan GUTTER]
Who traeted the commander and company of the Advise very dis?courtesly
and surrounded him with five of the dutch shipps, and on the next day the  said
English factors were commanded out of the Advise aboard the dutch
Commadore, And that the said English
factors then related to the dutch that they belonged unto the Licensed
East India Company of England and come forth upon their account
and that they desired and did hope and expect according to the articles
of Peace betweene the two nations, that without the least molestation
or interruption they might quietly saile into Bantam Roade, or that
their designed parts and dispose of themselves according to their Commissions
(And

And that the Hollanders then mentioned the English that they had expresse Commissions
to the contrary from their Generall in Battavia who had prohibited the same
and that therefore without their said generalls expresse order they would not
permitt them any accesse to Bantam, or to send thether or to receive any
thing or any advise from thense, and thereupon the English were necessitated
to send to Battavia to treate with the dutch generall, and sent mr Page
and Mr Mainst[XXX] two of the said English Companies factors who tooke their
passage thither in a dutch shipp called the Zirick Zee on or about the 19th
day of October aforesaid, but they retourning noe  answer from Batavia
the company in the said shipp Advise sailed her thether and arived about
the first of November, havving aboard mr Edwards and mr Streete two
others of the said English companies factors, And further that the said shipp
the draggon being come as is before expressed up to Pullambann point
her company the next morning espied sixe saile of dutch shipps
about five leagues distant, one of which shipps comming within shott
of the dragon, never haled but fired a gun with shott at her
Which the draggon answeered, and about halfe an howre after shee
fired a second on the dragon and had the like retourned, and then shee
fired a third, the shott passing betweene the draggons Maine and
foremast, and was likewise answered with a third gun from the dragon
and then and not before the said dutch shipp left the dragon. And
then being cleare of the said dutch shipp, the dragon anchored in
Bantam roade, and there received orders from the companies factors
then aboard her to sett saile thence for Jambee, and shee weighed anchor
accordingly, and shortly after namely on or about the last of October
in her course thether ward, shee was mett with and haled by a dutch
shipp, the commander or some of the company whereof told the
Captaine of the draggon that hee must come and speake with their
Admirall, to which hee answered that hee was bound for Jambee and
knew not their Admirall, and therewith all the m[XXXX] being [??calme]
and the currant against her the dragon came to an anchor, and
that presently another dutch shipp having 24 or 26 guns came and
anchored a[?head] of the dragon, and about halfe an houre after came
up aboard shipp of the dutch which haled the dragon and told the Captaine
that hee must come and speake with their Admirall, who replied that
hee could not come, upon which they threatened that they would
force him and therewithall [XXXX?red] close by the dragon, and ordered him [XXXXXX] [#]

in the other dutch shipp to prepare their guns, and sent the first shipp to acquaint their Admirall, who about eight
at night came in and anchored very neare the dragon, and sent his skiff with two dutch Captaines aboard her
who commanded the Captaine to come and speake with their Admirall, and that the said Captaine answered that
hee could not leave his shipp, but would send aboard to their Admirall, and [?soe] mr ffoulk[?s] Middleton one
of the merchants and mr John Wiltsha[X] his cheife mate went aboard the Admiralll, the mate was
permitted to retourne, but mr Middleton detained aboard, and that the said two dutch captaines comming the
[?second] [?time] aboard the dragon againe commanded the said Captaine Balliford to come aboard their Admirall, who
thereupon sent another man aboard the Admirall to acquaint him that hee would  not leave his shipp in the night
[XXXXXXXXXX] went on time in the morning which would not [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]

did indeed about twelve oclock at night force him to
leave his owne shipp and goe aboard their Admirall, who detained
him and mr Middleton and carried them and the said shipp dragon for Batavia, where the[?y]
arived on or about the first of November, and there the dutch Admirall comming aboard the dragon with tenn dutch m[?a]n
appointed them to continew there untill further order from the Generall
of Batavia, and then carried the said Captaine, and mr Middleton as
prisoners ashore, where they were kept [?close] in a house till the eigth
day of the same moneth. [ffarther] that from the 22th of October till the 26th
of November the said English cpmpanies factors remaining at Battavia
by severall letters and personall addresses sollicited the Generall and his
counsell for their admittance into Bantam and for libertie for [?the re]lading of their
shipps for England, but could not obtaine it. All which or in words to
the same effect hee saith is manifested in and by the letters and dispatches from
the said Commanders and factors from India, which hee this examinate

in case they had not bin soe XXXXXverd by the dutch and hindred and
stopped from their trade at Bantam and other parts or those
parts the said voyage, they might and in all probabilities would have brought
home their respective ladings of Pepper, and that the Advice being of
burthen as aforesaid, they were capable and might and would have taken
in at Bantam (had not the said interruption happened) 11110?40 lb of Pepper
which (as this deponent hath bin credibly informed) would there have bin
bought and laded at three pence sterling per pound, the expence

11110?40 lb of Pepper amount to about 33979 li - 6 s - 1 d sterling, which
Pepper hee saith would here have yeelded and bin worth twelve pence
sterling per pound, which for the said quantitie amounting to about
55552 li sterling, hee saith that the said Prime cost and the
said charges deducted, there remaineth about 21573 li - 13 s - 11 d

damnified, and further that by demourage of the said shipps

not the said abuse and hinderance bin donne by the dutch) at seaven
pounds sterling per diem (according to Charterpartie) for the
dragon amounteth to about 2555 li and for the Advice at eight
pounds sterling per diem amounteth to about 2920 li sterling,
makes the ?arlate dammage of the said English East India

redounding to the said company, and the whole English nation in the

of Pepper, for account of them the said Governours
and Company, and to bring the same so laded thence for
the fort Saint George, whense it was to have bin transported for England, and here to be delivered for the account
aforesaid, All which this deponent well knoweth to be true
for that he hath seene severall orders and Discpatches of
the said Company concerning the same./ He saith further that
he hath also seen letters and Advises, sent by the said Com=
panies ffactors, and Agents imployed by them in East India about the
said ships designe, signifying that upon the said ships arrivall
before Acheene, they went ashore to get leave of the Queen
of Acheene to lade her there with pepper, and that they had
obtained the same, and sent a letter from her, togeather with a translation
thereof, unto the said Company for their
satifaction. And that thereupon they the said ffactors
began to provide Pepper to lade the said ship for
the said Companies account, and had sent one boates lading
of Pepper to the side of the Mayflower to bee
laden and taken aboard her which said boats llading contained
fifty foure bagges weighing in the whole 3868 ?lb English
weight; And thais deponent saith that the said letters purported
further that there lay then before Acheene three Dutch
ships (Commanded by one Balthazar Bort) in the immediate

said Bort seeing the foresaid boat laden with Pepper by the side
of the May flower, sent and seized the same, and caused it to
be carried and put aboard one of his three shipps named the
Concordia, which being done the dutch turned off the Mayflowers,
boat againe, ?but prohibited and forbad them to bring any
more Pepper from shore afterwards, so that the voyage was
wholly disappointed and frustrated to the great losse and
damage of the said English Company. And that, (also according
to the further Purport of the said letters) the Commander of the
May flower Captaine William Curtis, seeing the Premisses, went,
on board the ship of the said Balthazor Bort, and demanded
of him the Pepper by his order seized and taken out of the
May flowers long boat. and reasoned with the said Bort touch-
ing the foresaid Action, but was denied his Pepper, nor
could hee get any satifaction therefore; whereupon he and
John Sled and William Smith (two of the Companies ffactors)
or Agent there) made a Protest against the said Dutch,  and
against such their Actions, and after sent to the said English company a Copy thereof
signed by a Notary publique and themselves which this deponent hath seene, and

when this deponent soe met him after the said
seizure this deponent challenging him with
their said meeting and and the discourse that hath
betweene them off the Cape finisterra,
this deponent asked him where was his chest
of plate that hee had bespoke of him, the said
van lymen shrugged up his shoulders. and further
hee saith that the said van lymen being in his said
passage for Tolon after the seizure asked
by this deponent and others to whom his lading of
goods belonged, hee [xxxxxsted] that hee did not knowe

they


HCA 13/73 f.448r Annotate
they had throwne their papers overboard, but
afterwards they proved to be Spaniards and let them
passe.  And saith it is well knowne to this deponent
and all sea commanders that noe Spanish Admirall
or Spanish commander in chief meeting with any
shipp or shipps coming from Santa Domingo or other
place in the Spanish West Indies with
goods or lading there taken in, will or dare let
them passe freely (as the Saint Mary was supposed
to passe) without seizing them unlesse they
were sufficiently satisfied that the said shipp or shipps
were laded for the account of Spaniards or
Spanish subjects.  And further hee deposeth not, saving

hee cannot depose.

To the crosse Interrogatories. [CENTRE HEADING]

To the first hee saith hee cometh required by Mr
Goodwin the Sub Commissioner for prizes at dover to be

officer


HCA 13/73 f.448v Annotate

the countreys where they are naturall.

To the third hee saith that his said frigot was one
of the frigots of the Squadron of Admirall Stokes, and doth not
expect any share in the Mary (or her lading, but [?XX GUTTER]

To the fourth hee saith hee hath first knowne the said
shipp Saint Mary and John van lynen her master from the said time of meeting her

To the 10th hee saith hee heard the said John van
lynen confesse that hee brought the Spanish merchant
(who asked and did the busines about the lading at
Santa domingo) to Spaine and had there landed [?him GUTTER]
and beleeveth that the Spaniards taken in at Santa
Cruze were really for Spanish service and [?account GUTTER]
and that both shipp and goods belong to Spaniards
and soe farr as hee from beleeving that [?the GUTTER]
Spanish Captaine and
officers were taken in for a colour, that hee
verily beleeveth that the said van [?XXX] [?went ?with GUTTER]
her only for a colour to serve the Spaniard[?X GUTTER]
[?XXXX], and for Moller hee doth not beleeve
hee had noe accomodation in the shipp like one of
the


HCA 13/73 f.449r Annotate
[?that] qualitie, but on the contrary a Spaniard (whom the said
Moller pretended to be his man) had silke quilts and other
very good accomodation like the principall marchant which
occasioned this deponent then to say that the man is better
accomodated than the master.

To the eleaventh hee saith that the said van lynen
would sometimes say the shipp was his and his owners,
but never [?declared] who those owners were, but
for the goods hee would never say what they were
but often protested hee never knew whose they were.
And therefore and for the reasons aforesaid hee this
deponent verily beleeveth them to belonge to Spaniards
and not to hollanders, and addeth for confirmation
of this his beleefe, that a ffrenchman that was att
Tolon, when the Saint Mary was brought up said that
the said van lynen in the Saint Mary under the Spanish flagg had met a ffrench shipp that hee
was in, in the Streights mouth or thereabouts and

for offence or defence, but it was through fraud that they spreas those
colours, to [?XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX to] deceive this deponent and others, such being as hee saith their

they having this deponent aboard to set him ashore, comming neere Marget
and seeing a frigot come off from Marget, they skulked amongest
some ffishermen that were there fishing, and least the said frigot should
perceive them to be Capers and hale them, and understand how they
seized the vessells of English and dutch by Swedish commission[?s] under English
colours, they hung up severall mackerells in their tackle (it being

did, or to that effect, And saith that the said Peere head is the
ordinary ad usuall place from whence goods are sent onboard

would not come up any neerer And further cannot
depose.

To the 8th. hee saith that the reason why the said Ship

and upon the accompt of the said producents hire and take the said shipp the
Golden Sun (whereof the said Adolph Wyngaerts was master) to freight at

or Notarial Contract made and passed betweene the said Bolyn de la Gard
as freighter or taker on the one part and the said Wyngaerts as letter on

said [?wyngarts] and blamed him for such his delay and for neglecting his
Imployers occasions, telling how the weather had bin faire and how that
other shipps from England ffrance and other places had arived at dublin while
he was loytering by the way or to that effect, and this deponent then and there
severall times required him the said wyngarts to proceese with his said
shipp for dublin, and this deponent the next day (after such his
coming by horse to Waterford) retourning for dublin left strict charge
and order with the said winegaerts to make all spped away with his shipp
for dublin, whether this deponent (as hee told him) would gow before to
get all things in a readines for his lading, and soe this deponent departed
by land for dublin, but while hee was soe at Waterford, hee was as
hee saith tiold and made acquainted by ffishermen and others and
by some of the said wyngaerts owne company, that hee had neglected
the oportunitie of wine and weather and staid at Waterford when hee
had severall times oportunitie of going for dublin with his said shipp.
And further hee doth not depose, saving the said producents are much
damnified by such delay of the said wyngarts, and saving that the said
Wyngarts (as this deponent was credibly informed) staid with his shipp
about thirtie dayes at Waterford when hee might have gonne for dublin.

To the 8th and 9th articles hee saith and deposeth that this deponent staying and
waiting at dublin for the arivall of the Golden Sunne which hee daily expected
according to the charhe and order which hee had soe lost with the said wyngarts
at Waterford, there arived at dublin on the six and twentieth of december
1659 a shipp called the Mary of Middleborow (William dunkin master)
which master told this deponent (making enquirie after the Golden Sun)
that the said shipp the Golden Mary (sic) came then from Waterford, and
that the said sjipp the Golden Sun departed thence two houres before
her on the 25th of december aforesaid to come for dublin with the winde faire, and therefore hee
finding her not at dublin, advised what was become of her. But
afterwards namely on the said twelveth of January 1659 and not
before, the said wynegartz as aforesaid came and arived with his
said shipp at dublin, and this deponent then blaming him for his delay
and telling him there that the said shipp the Mary which came out of
Waterford after him, was arived at dublin above a fortnight before
him, and demannding of him how it came soe to passe, the said wyneharts
confessed and said that hee by the way had put with his said shipp
into Wexford Roade and had come there to an anchor, and bu that
meanes had lost the oportunitie of winde which ranne contrary, and
this examinate saith that the said wynegarts at Waterford made some mention
to this deponent of putting into Wexford roade with his shipp and soe to goe through
the bancks in his passage for dublin. but this deponent expressely
forbade him, and chardged him to come directly for dublin without
going into Wesford roade, which hee saith the said Wynegarts
neglected, at least ommitted to doe, and soe the voyage was delayed.

To the tenth article hee saith and deposeth That after the premisses
and when the said shipp the Golden Sun departed from the said port of
dublin, namely in ot about the beginning of ffebruary 1659, this deponent
factor of and for the said producents gave speciall order and direction
to the said Adolph Wyngarerts to goe with and saile her to the River
of Kilmare in the West of Ireland, And in regard that the said
Wyngaerts was not well acquainted with that coast this deponent
provided and put a sufficient and experienced pilot aboard named
George Bird to pilot her thither, and desired the sayd Wyngaerts

or the [?XXX] spent that soe hee might come with the said lading to a good
market, or to the same effect, howbeit the said Wyngaerts not regarding
such pressing and urging of this deponent, neglected and lost oportunities
of winde and weather, as if hee had purposely intended to retard the
said voyage, of this deponents knowledge, And soe likewise in comming
from Cadiz for London hee forstowed and neglected his passage and
lost oportunities as aforesaid, soe that hee was longer in comming with
the said shipp (then otherwise hee needed to have bin) by the space of
six or seaven dayes or thereabouts.

To the 23th and last articles hee saith that in the whole voyage the said Wyngaerts
spent more time and was longer in performing the same than
hee needed to have bin by the space of foure monethes, which delay
hee (as this deponent conceiveth) purposely sought and [?more]
because his shipp was freighted by the moneth. And saith tha the
said hopkins, dunster, Gregory and company by reason of the
many and severall neglects, omissions and misdemeanours of the said
Wyngaerts the said voyage and his loosing opportunities of winde and
weather, insufficiencie of his shipp., losse of markets by his meanes
and other his miscarriages the said voyage, have suffered losse and damage

Saint Lucars, did for some time borrow certaine of the said Wingarts men
and while they were aboard the Lionesse this deponent heard some of them

for a rogue, for wee had time enough when wee were on the coast of

from Ireland too late for the [?lent] market and for the Gallions, lost the
oportunitie of a good maarket, and soe John Hamilton the Supra cargo
was necessitated to sell some of the said lading as hee could finde [?XXXX GUTTER]
and that the commannder of the lionesse bought a small quantitie
of the Golden Suns beef, butter and herings and candles, that which this deponent (as hee saith)
never saw better, and saith that if the said shipp had arived with her
said lading in the bay of Cadiz avout two monethes sooner then shee did
her commodities (as it was there commonly reported and said)
would have sold at very high rates, there being then greate want
thereof in those parts. And further hee deposeth not.

the fflower de luna which plied on her voyage, when they bore up againe
with the Golden Sun in the downes) asking him why they kept not their
voyage on with the fflower de luna, the said mate answered, that the
fflower de luna sailed by the voyage, but the Golden Sun by the moneth,
which words hee having uttered blushed, and seemed sorry for
having made that acknowledgement. And further deposeth not, saving
that at Cadiz before the arivall of the said shipp the Golden Sun this deponent
heard Mr Wilky a factor there and his partner who expected her, much
lamment her long stay and complaine thereof, in regard the market was
then soe good that shee could not have come to a better, and that the
