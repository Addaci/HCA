saile as hee imagined and told his company thereof and willed

alsoe for that he was entered into deepe water and had broken his
strupp of his yard rope and was busy in mending the same, he
never regarded or looked after the said saile any more/

Ad septium affirma vera esse that the saile which this examinate espied

that they in the said hoy teh Christofer were at such

his company wente into when they hoy sence and said sired them
selves they had perished with the hoy and her lading, and at they
