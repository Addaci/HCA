Thomas Andrews de Wapping in parochia
Sancta Mariae Matselon alias Whitechappell
annos agens 42 aut circiter 
testis product et Juratus

Ad dictam allegaconnem deponit et dicit that hee hath for severall
yeers last knowne the allegate ship Jonathan and Abigaill Thomas
Morley Master. And saith that hee hath bin informed by the said
Morley and the Merchants the ffreighters that the said Charles
Caryll on behalfe of himselfe and Company tooke to ffreighte
the said shipp Jonathan and Abigall two hundred and fowrty tonnes
vertaine to the best of his remembrance to goe from this port of
London to Archangels in Russia thence back againe to this port of
London with such goods as the said Caryll and the rest of ye freighters
should send a board, and the said ffreighters as appeares by the said
Charterparty were to pay for ffreight at the rate of 6li 10s per tonne
And saith that about the time of the said affreightment there was
a generall Embargo upon all English shipps and a generall Impresse for
all Seamen in the publique Servive, and the said Caryll taking notice
thereof this deponent heard him promise to procure a lycense for
the said shipp and a proteccon for her mariners from the said Impresse
And not long after the said promise hee saith the said Caryll gave by the
hands of this deponent to the said Morley a paper or writing which hee
the said Caryll affirmed to this deponent was a lycense for ye said shippe to
proceed upon the said voyage as also a protection for the security
of ye mariners from the said Impresse. And the said Morley having
soe received the same fitted and prepared the said shipp for the said
voyage and Expended as hee cerily beleeveth in the Calking, graveing
rigging and fitting her out clearing at ye Custome house and at
Gravesend neere one hundred pounds ye whole charge amounteth to about 400li to sett her to sea and did hire mariners to saile
and serve in the said shipp, the whole company with the Master and boy
consisting of 34 or 36 persons and provided and furnished the said shipp with
provisions Necessaries for the said voyage for the space of foure or
five monthes. And the said shipp being ready the said Merchants sent
severall goods on board to bee carryed in her the said voyage but
he beleeveth that the said Merchants were not bound to send any goods
aboard but the sais shipp might have gon in her ballast thither
And the said ship lying windbound in Bugbyes hole being ready
to proceede upon the said voyage the said Morley in this deponents
hearing advised the said Caryll and Bell two of his said ffreighters to goe
downe to ye Generalls of ye ffleete then riding at the buoy in the Nore
and to carry with them ye said passe or protecccon as they afirmed it
to bee and show it to ye Generall and know of them whether by vertue
thereof they might proceede upon their said voyage Howbeit the said
Caryll and Bell refused soe to doe and with the ffreighters importuned

HCA 13/76 f.1v Annotate

importuned and urged the said Morley to goe downe with his shipp
which hee accordingly did with the first faire wind the said Caryll
and Berry two of ye said ffreighters going downe in the said Morleys shipp
and Bell and Thersby in this deponents shipp which shipp was also ffreighted
by the said Caryll and Company for the said voyage and was to goe in Company
with the Jonathan and Abigall. And comming into the Buoy and the Nore
the Generalls commanded the said Morley and this deponents shipp to an Anchor
and sent for the merchants and the said Morley and this deponent who
accordingly comming aboard Captaine Hobart Captaine  of Royall Charles
told the said Morley and this deponent that ye Prince and the Duke would
see their proteccons, And the said Morley and this deponent accordingly
gave him the very same papers that Mr Caryll had before
given them which they had affirmed to bee the lycense and protteccon aforesaid, and after
some smal time the said Hobart gave them the very same papers againe
saying that the Genearlls had seene them. And saith that about the
same time ye Generalls under their hands sent an order to the said Captaine 
Hobart to empresse and the said Hobart or some employed under him did by
virtue of the said Warrant impresse all ye seamen saving fifteene men to bring the
shippe back into the river of Thames. And much about that time
the said Captaine Hobart and the Lievetenant of ye Royall Charles told
this deponent and ye said Morley that had teh Merchants come downe before the
shipps and addrest themselves to ye Generalls they beleived teh Generalls
would have suffered them to have proceeded on their said voyage
with their full number of men and not have imprest them
The premisses hee deposeth and knoweth to bee true Having seene
ye Charter party and to his best remembrance seing the same
signed, And ffor that this deponent lett his shipp to ffreight to the said
Caryll and Company and was bound to goe the same voyage
and being an eye and Eare witnesse of the premisses and
acquainted therewith. And the merchants hee saith were also aboard
and were Eye and Eare witnesses of ye premisses namely of the Impresse
of the men and sending the said shipps back againe into the river
of Thames where she came to an Anchor at Tatcliffe Chaine on or about the 30th
or 31th of June last past, Et aliter nescit deponere./.
