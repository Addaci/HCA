Ad sextum et septimum articulos alluis exaite Casineva secundum Sess Ter in
Pascho ultimum et amplius datus et oblatus dicit et deponit That
this examinate havinge notice that a prize taken for the
Spaniard by the dutch having aboard her sugers and other
commodities was at Owavers lake in the bay of Pensance,
wente thither to see yf hee could buy sugers or
other commodities at a reasonable rate out of her and uppon
New yeares day last paste or therabouts in a boate went aboard the
said shippe called (as those aboard her said) the Saint
Barbara then rideinge at an anchor in safety in
Owavers lake aforesaid, and then founde divers
Hollanders in the said shippe who had the
commannd of her, and amongste them some Spaniardes
and at that tyme this examinate by discourse with
a dutchman who was said to bee Leiutenant of the said
shippe and some other dutchmen of her company, this
examinate was informed that the said shippe had bin taken
at sea by two Holland men of warr and that at sea by
storme shee was separated from those menn of warr
but hee remembreth not whether they tolde
him that shee was by extremity of weather and crosse
windes driven into the harbour or Porte of Pensance
or into some other Porte in or neere the County of
Cornwall or not, and haveing by aboard her aboute
halfe an houre in Owavers lake aforesaid this examinate
with his boate returned a shoare, and fower or five
of the Spaniardes which hee founde aboard the said
shippe as aforesaide when this examinate came out of the
said shippe the Santa Barbara, came alsoe out of her
with this examinates boate to goe ashoare, and this examinate
in his boate sett them on shoare at Newland in the
County of Cornwall neere to the said shippe
where they desired to bee landed, and soe this examinate
returned home about thirteene miles from the said
shippe and within some few dayes after, a messinger
came to this examinats brother master ffrances Bassett the
Viceadmirall of the North of Cornwall and
advertized him that the said shippe the Santa Barbara
was in distresse and a grounde in the bay of
Pensance, and that the Country people were ready
to pillage her, And thereuppon this examinate and his
said brother with some others went forthwith to the

the Santa Barbara driven a shoare and suncke uppon the
Rockes in the said bay of Pensance soe that every highe
water, the sea flowed over her deckes and they were inforced
both by the company of the said shippe, as alsoe by
the Inhabitants of in those parts that by extreamity
of weather her Cables by which shee was moored
brake, and soe shee drove uppon the Rocks and suncke
and shee was made unserviceable and
unfitt for any further voyage at sea And this
hee affirmeth to bee true, Al aliter ad humior
articulos nescit deponere, Saveinge that when this
examinate was aboard the said shippe on or about New yeares
day as aforesaid hee was informed
that the Captaine was gon to Plymouth to gett menn
of warr to convey her to fflushinge in Zealand,
and when this examinate came to her
uppon notice of her sinckeinge as aforesaid
hee sawe two shippes Holland shippes rideing by her
which had (as yt was said) divers goodes aboard
them which were taken out of the Sta Barbara
after shee came into the bay of Pensance before
shee was driven uppon the Rockes aforesaid,
and those shippes with the goods in them were
since (as hee hath heard) arrested at Plymouth, soe that hee
beleeveth that all the goodes in this cause
arrested sequestred were in the Saint Barbara
when shee came firste into the bay of Pensance
because those shippes were not then there when
as this examinate went firste aboard the Sta Barbara
in that bay as aforesaid and hee beleeveth that all the wett goodes
arrested and sequestred were in her when shee
was driven uppon the Rockes and suncke as
aforesaid, but beleeveth that the goodes arrested in
the said two shippes at Plymouth xx that were drye
and some hides delivered which Captaine Polkin Horne had to
the number of (as Captaine Polkin Horne said to this
examinats best remembrance) of one hundred hides
or therabouts and a small loafe of sugar, as alsoe
for which Captaine Polkin Horne disbursed monies
of furnished victualls for the xx xxx of the Hollanders in the Sta Barbara
as this examinate as this examinate heard some of those
Hollanders as alsoe Captaine Polkin Horne himself
say and 2 horses, and were landed taken out of the

about two shipps length neerer to the shoare but before she
was weighed from thence this deponent rowed rounde abord her
to see if he could espye any buoy or beacon neere unto her but could finde none but presently
after she was weighed from that place, at the first still of the floud

where the sayd shipp was weighed, and then this deponent rowed to the sayd
buoye, and indeavoured twice to take up the sayd buoy into his boate but the buoy rope was
soe short that he could not pull the sayd buoy all out of the water, nor
higher up from the water then it shewed itselfe wherof

Hannce Beckers and that hee soulde them for the use of the
said Hannce ecker, and that hee woulde not have taken
soe much paines but onely to gett his owne money in for
that hee said that Hannce Becker owed him
upwards of fifty poundes, and the steersman of the
Kinge David asked this examinate when hee wente aboard
the Kinge David to fetch away the said twelve
butts of sacke whether hee this examinate had bought
the Masters wynes, And this hee affirmeth to bee

of this his examinacon was straight

conceive and are cleerly of opinion that the

which altered the said firste marcke to the

Ad 21um affirmat That the said Sadler soulde
the said wynes to this examinate or nyne poundes a butt
one with another filled upp ashoare, and hee
beleeveth that when this examinate bought them they
were well worth eleaven poundes a butt one with annother

of the passengers (whereof this examinate was one)
went on shoare at Bluboroughe Castle to buy

well furnished with victualls, this examinate and the
other sixe passengers went from thense by land
to Newcastle where wilkinson promised to take
them in againe, but came not thither accordinge

Ad septimum affirmat, That hee sawe about fower or five peeces of
beefe brought aboard the said shippe at Archangell by some
of that shippe, and this examinate afterwardes in the said
homewardes voyage heard those passingers demannd
their beef againe of the said Styward and he told them
in this examinates heareinge that the said Wilkinson had
give him order not to deliver yt to them but in their
allowance of victualls, And this hee affirmeth to
bee true, At aliter nescit;/

Ad octavum affirmat, That after they came on this side the
Northerne Cape, and by space of about a moneth before they arived
at Bamboroughe Castle as aforesaid, the said Wilkinson
then pretendinge himselfe to bee Master of the said shippe
and havinge the keeping of her victualls did proportion and
allowe the Company and passingers in the said
shippe a very smale portion and allowance of victualls
especially the passingers, but some tymes hee gave the
Marriners betweene meales and after the passingers
were in bedd some  drincke and of the last of their bread gave each of his company five bisketts and each passinger but one biskett and whilest they were
putt to such small allowance being uppon the coaste of
Norway, the passingers desired the said Wilkinson
to put them on shoare there tellinge him that they coulde
not subsiste with that shorte allowance, which hee the
said Wilkinson tolde them that hee would not put them
on shoare before hee came to England, and that
hee woulde make them sucke their Clawes before
they came into England, and that hee cared not for
them yf hee coulde save save but three or fower alive to
steere his shippe, And indeed the said Wilkinson
for want of provideinge more water and bread in
Russia where hee mighte have had plenty thereof at
very easy rates, did bringe the Company and passingers
in the said shippe to extreame want, soe that by the space of about thirty dayes togeather hee
allowed them but two silver spoonefulls of water
to each mann for a day, and noe other liquor soe that
this examinate and his wief and all the reste of the said passingers and
some of the seamen in this examinates sighte were inforced

to drincke their owne water mingled with salte water
many tymes within those thirty dayes, and for eleaven dayes
togeather they had noe bread at all to this examinats
sight or knowledge, soe that they were inforced to
eate parched pease in stead of bread and those
pease were soe dry that they coulde not gett them
downe for wante of water, and whilst they were in
that extreame want of water and drincke, when
yt rained one tyme, the said wilkinson
kepte the passingers downe and nayled downe the
hatches uppon them and kepte them under hatches from
the Eveninge untill the nexte day about twelve a
clocke, soe that they coulde not come to save any
of the raine water, but were inforced to buy some of
yt of the Marriners and this examinats wief was 
soe extreame dry, that shee gave one of the
Marriners of the said shippe three Reex
dollers, which is fifteene shillings sterlinge for
a quantity of raine water not avove a quarter of a pinte that that Marriner
had saved, and whelst
they were in such extreame wante of water and
drincke, the said wilkinson allowed them noethinge
but salte meates, which they coulde not eate for
want of water or drincke, and at that tyme the sayd
wilkinson had cheese which was not soe salte
as the other meates and some sweete meates and gammons
