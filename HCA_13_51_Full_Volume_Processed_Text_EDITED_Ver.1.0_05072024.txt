then it was a shipp cast away in Biskay bound to the Newfoundland

by English mercahnts, and denyeth that he ever declared
or made knowne that he had heard of the castinge away of the
sayd shipp the ffortune (wherof the sayd Sampson de Michelance
as master, to the interrogate Nathan Wright or any of his servants or to any one else
to his nowe best remembrance:/

To the second he sayeth That he neither knoweth beleiveth or ever

a shippe called the Eagle whereof this examinate was parte
Owner of the burthen of three hundred and thirty tonnes
was Lett  to freighte to the Greenland Adventurers
at the rate of eighty poundes sterlinge a moneth
for a Merchannts voyage for the whale killinge and
continued in that service after that tyme by the
space of five monethes and twentye dayes and soe
much at the leaste shee was worth to ee Lett to freighte for
a Merchants voyage, And this hee affirmeth uppon
his oath to bee true who beeing then husband for the
said Adventurers and an adventurer in the ame voyage
was trusted with Captaine Goodladd for the
freightinge of all such shippes as the said
Adventurers sett out that yeare, for the voyage
aforesaide, and which the said Goodladd tooke to
freighte the said  shippe the Eagle amongst others,
Ac aliter nescit:/

Ad secundum et tertium articulos nescit deponere, Savinge that hee
goeing upp and downe the river of Thames to hire shippes
for the Adventurers to Greenland aforesaid, hath
often seene in the said river a shippe flemishe builte
called the Seahorse shaped after the Englishe fashion
a Longe shippe, but of what burthen shee was
hee cannott declare for that to his knowledge
hee never was aboard her since her buildinge
because shee was a shippe not fitt for their voyage
in regard of the ice flemishe builte shippes not beeing soe stronge commonly as
Englishe builte shippes nor of soe greate force or defence
~~~
HCA 13/51 f.36v [CHECKED]

as Englishe shippinge of the like burthen are and beeing
deeper in holde then Englishe shippinge of the like burthen haveing but
two decks doe carry more teere of caske one
uppon the other to fill their holde whereby in
Liquid commodities as oyle or the like tere
arriseth farr more leakage by the weighte
thereof wringe the caske, then arriseth in
Englishe shipping carrieinge but three teere
of butts or pipes in the holde, and hee
saieth that hee never tooke any shippe to
freighte for a reprizall voyage by the moneth
nor ever knewe of any that was soe taken
to freighte, and therefore cannott say what
the seahorse was worth by the moneth to
bee freighted for such voyage, Ac aliter nescit
Savinge that hee in this examinate in his Judgement
conceiving that such a shippe as the Seahorse
aforesaid seemeth to bee  beeing  fitted
with  twenty peeces of Ordnannce powder shott
and all other thinges fittinge thereunto, as
alsoe with Cables, shifts of sailes, roapes, and
all other necessary furniture too supply
of what mighte bee spente in fighte, weare and
teare and other casualties in a reprizall voyage,

to freight for a reprizall voyage in regard of her
countenance and force the summe of one hundred and
tenn or one hundred poundes sterlinge per moneth at the
Leaste, whereas hee conceiveth that a flemishe Merchants
shippe shaped as the Seahorse was of the burthen 
of three hundred tonns fitted with ordnannse and
all necessary furniture, tackle, sailes, Cordage
pwder shott and all other necessaries for such a
reprizall voyage accordinge say a
shippe of one hundred and fifty lasts which
wee usuall rate three hundred tonns cann conveniently
carry and use for offense or defence is not
worth to bee lett to freight for a reprizall voyage for
sixe monethes to the coast of Spaine or the

above seaventy five poundes per moneth or fower score
at the utmoste, and that  an Englishe or dutch shipp
of the Like burthen for a  Marchants voyage

their speeches, conferringe with this examinate
what they were beste to doe, said that they were
ordered to bee with the said shippe backe at Teneriffe

and that yf the Mathew shoulde goe to the Matheraes
and there bee confiscated and Mr Stoner should wante
a shippe to carry home those wynes they

the Mathew was a Hollandes bottome and denied to give her
despatches, and sente the Scrivana to view her, who
sente menn aboard her to that purpose, who returned

and did by Leakeage damnefie the said Mr Delabarrs

there, and with the monies which shoulde have bin reaceaved
from the Mathera freight, and the money made
of the packe of Lynnen and trusse of woollen cloth
belonginge to the said Delabarr might have boughte
and laded as much Corne at Lancerott as she carried from
tehnse to Teneriffe, and with the same might (as
hee conceiveth) have bin as soone at Teneriffe

Lancerott expectinge the Spaniards Corne, as in
rpobabilitye she would have bin uppon the Mathera
voyage, and in buyeinge and reladeinge as much Corne
as shee carried to Teneriffe, because for money shee
might have had Corne presently, soe that this

by reason that the said shippe was flemishe builte and
thereby loste the freightes aforesaid hath
sustained damage to the same of one hundred and
fifty poundes sterleinge or thereabouts besides the

Ad primum articulum allius ex parte Delabarr in hac parte dat et
oblat nescit deponere:

Ad secundum articulum affirmat, That the articulate shippe the Mathew
arrived at Larratavo in the Canary Islandes the second
day of December laste and haveing dischardged all her outward
ladeinge there excepte a fardell or trusse of welch
Cottons, sett saile from thence intendinge to saile
to Lancertott to seeke a freighte of Cornm but
by contrary windes was forced to come within sight
of the Matheraes and there lay becalmed two or three
dayes, and then the firste winde that blewe that
was fitt to saile with a great flemishe man of warr that
had taken a Portugall Carvell laden with sugars
came upp with the Mathew righte before the Matheraes
and sent for William Copeland the Master of the Mathew
and this respondent to come aboard his mann of warr
and spake to them to take into the Mathew his Portugall
prisones and to lande them at the Matheraes, which this
examinate denied to doe and tolde the flemish
Captine that as yet they had noe busines at the Mathereas
nor woulde they goe in there yf the winde woulde give
them leave to saile to Lancerott, and with that answere
Lefte the mann of warr and wente againe aboard the
Mathew leaveing still the said Copeland in the flemishe
mann of warr, and soone after those prisoners were
sente out of the said mann of warr into the Mathew
and Copeland returned againe into the Mathew after those
prisoners were come aboard her to this examinates beste
remembrance, and Copeland tolde this examinate that hee
~~~
HCA 13/51 f.106r [HAND TRANSCRIBED] [CHECKED]

106

was afraide that the said mann of warr would have donn him
some mischeife yf hee had not taken in the said prisoners
and therefore hee the said Copeland tooke them into the Mathew
and the nexte day with the Mathews boate landed the
one half of those prisoners at the Matherases, and whileste those
were landinge before the boate woulde returne againe aboard the
Mathew a storme arose which drew the Mathew to sea, this
examinate beeing then a shoare at the Matheraes goeing a shoare there
in the boate with those prisoners, and the Mathea in that
storme was soe driven to sea that shee coulde not reciver
the Matheraes in lesse then three dayes after shee sent
her boate on shoare there with the one half of the prisoners as
as aforesaide and soe shee putt into the Matheraes and landed
the rest if the prisoners there but hee saieth that 
lyeing becalmed within sight of the Matheraes as aforesaid
yt was resolved betweene theis examinate and the said Copeland
to put in with the Mathew to the Matheraes to seeke fir a
freight there for Lancerott for the good of their voyage,
before they sawe the said flemishe mann of warr or her
prize and hee saieth that presently after their arrivall
at the Matheraes, this examinate did aggree with nyne
Spaniards and Portugalls to carry them as passingers
and some small quantities of goods from the Matheraes
to Lancerott for nine poundes sterlinge and hee
conceiveth that yf the Mathew had carried those
oassengers and their goods, some other or more people with
their goods would have gonn as passingers in her from
the Mathraes for Lancertott and the money for their passage
and goods most have come and bin due to the said Delabarr
And this hee affirmeth to bee true who went in the
Mathea from London that voyage, and sailed in her all
her voyage untill shee cane from Teneriffe homewardes
bounde, beinge appointed by Mr John Stoner brother to Peter
Stoner to whom the Mathew and her ladeing was consigned at
the Canaries with the consent of the said Delabarr, to
assiste the said Peter Stone in the performanse of the
voyage as a ffactor Ac aliter :/

Ad tertiumm affirmat That the passingers aforesaide did say and
promise to this examinate that when they camme to
Lancerott, they and their frendes woulde presently fully lade
the Mathew with Corne of Lancerott, to bee brought backe to
the Matheraes, and would give freight for the same,
a tetoone a Hannack, which is
fifteene pence three farthings sterlinge a Hannacke

HCA 13/51 f.106v [HAND TRANSCRIBED] [CHECKED]

and the Master of the Mathew William Copeland calculated
that shee woulde have carried from the Matheraes to
Lancerott two thousand Hannockes of Corne
which by computacon woulde
have bin worth the said Delabarr, the sume
of 125li besides yf those passingers had failed
of their promise to lade her there was then
greate store of Corne at Lancerott to have
laden her for the Matheraes yf shee had not
bin flemishe bulte as they founde uppon
their arrivall afterwards at Lancerott, And
this hee affirmeth to bee true, Ac aliter nescit./

Ad quartum affirmat That presently after the arrivall
of the said shippe the Mathew at the Matheraes, this
examinate and the said Copeland the Master of her were
there tolde by Englishe ffactors resideing there
that they feared much that they should not
carry the Mathea away againe from thense beeing
flemishe builte, for that there was then
another shippe manned with Englishmen flemishe
builte which came from London and
rodd then at an anchor in the Mathera road, which
they said was few dayes before confescated
because shee was flemishe built, by vertue
of a commannde which they said was come from
the Kinge of Spaines forbiddinge all shippes
flenishe builte manned with any other but
his owne subiects, to trade in any of his
dominions and Robert Odierne the Master of
that shippe was then on shoare at the Matheraes
and related to this examinate that his
shippe was then confescated because shee was
flemishe built by vertue of the commannde
of the Kinge of Spaine as aforesaide and that hee and his servants were turned out of her And
this hee affirmeth to bee true, Ac aliter nescit:
Saveing that one of the said Odiernes servants
came and was entertained in the Mathew at
Lancerott and this examinate heard the said Odiernes
Carpenter speake to him at the Matheraes for his wages for the
tyme that hee had served in his shippe, soe that
hee verily beleeveth that the said Odiernes shippe
was there confescated as hee related:/

Ad quintum et sextum affirmat, That the foresaide Englishe ffactors
at the Matheraes by reason of the premisses advised this
examinate to departe thense with the Mathew with all the
speed that they coulde because shee was flemishe builte
sayeing that otherwise they feared that shee woulde bee
confiscated and loste there and Copeland the Master of her
tolde him that they had given the like advice to him and hee
saieth that the Mathew arrived at the Matheraes
uppon the sonday, and the advice aforesaid was given to
this examinate aboute the wednesday next followeinge
but this examinate and the Master of the Mathew notwithstandinge
that advice still resolved to stay to take in the aforesaid
passingers and their goods, but on the ffryday nexte
followeing those passingers refused absolutely to goe themselves
in the Mathew or to sende theire goods on board
sayeing that the Mathew by sighte seemed to bee a
flemishe builte shiippe, and hat they feared that shss had
some consorte at sea some flemishe mann of warr,
and mighte betray them and their goodes into their handes,
and soe looseing that freighte and feareinge the seizure
of the Mathew at the Matheraes because shee was
flemishe builte yt was resolved betweene this
examinate and the Master of the Mathew to take the firste
opportunity to begonn from thense and on the saterday
nighte nexte followeinge about tenn or eleaven of the
cloce in the nighte the Mathew weighed anchor and
departed from the Matheraes, haveinge aboard her
onely for the said Delabarr one bale of welch Cottons
contayneinge twelve peeces, and for a Spaniard fower
pipes of Canary wyne, and for Peter Stoner a little
[?tousse] of course Linnens, and a little bale of course
kersies, which shee broughte from Loratavo, and with
those and noe other goods shee sailed to Lancerott and
there arrived as hee remembreth the 11th of March
laste paste stilo Romano, And this hee affirmeth to
bee true, Ac aliter nescit./

Ad septium nescit deponere aliter qua prius, Saveinge that for
the reasons aforesaide hee beleeveth that yf the Mathew
had not come away in the night as shee did from the
Matheraes, in probabilitye shee had bin confiscated and loste
there and yt was the arte of the Master and company of her
with the consente of this examinate to bringe her from the
~~~
HCA 13/51 f.107v [HAND TRANSCRIBED] [CHECKED]

Matheraes as they did whereby hee conceiveth shee was
saved from confiscation and he saieth that hee hath
seen the said Delabarr pay some of the company of
the Mathew since they came home wages for
the said voyage and hee hath heard that tHE said
Delabarr, victualled her for that voyage,

Ad octavum affirmat, That presently after the arrivall of
the said shippe the Mathew at Lancerott from the
Matheraes, there was a freight of Corne
foffered to this examinate by some
spaniardes and Portugalls to bee carried from
thense to the Matheraes, and they offered to lad
her with Corne and to give the usuall price for
freighte thereof as was then given, which (as
this examinate was tolde by a ffrenchman that then
laded his shippe with Vorne there) was a
testoone a Hannocke and soe much hee said hee
had, and had had the like there three or fower
tymes, and this examinate knoweth that every
testoone is current in the Canary Islandes
for 15d 3 farthinges sterlinge and the Master
of the Mathew said that shee would have
carried two thousand Hannocks of Corne
from Lancerott to the Matheraes, by which
computacon that freight would have bin
worth 125li sterleinge, and those Portugalls and
Spaniardes offered to lade her at Lancerott with
Corne within tenn dayes after the Mathews
arrivall at Lancerott, And this hee affirmeth
to bee true, Ac aliter nescit/

Ad nonum affirmat That the nexte day after the
offer of the freighte aforesaid at Lancerott, one
Mr John Dell as Englishe ffactor came to
Lancerott (as hee said) from the Matheraes
and told this examinate, that the said shippe the Mathew
shortly after shee was gonn from the Matheraes
was there condemppned and confiscated to the
~~~
HCA 13/51 f.108r [HAND TRANSCRIBED] [CHECKED]

108

use of the Kinge of Spaine, and sentence of confiscation
pronounced against her there, and that hee feared that yf
shee stayed at Lancerott shee would bee seized on
there by order from the Matheraes, And this hee
affirmeth to bee true, Ac aliter nescit:/

Ad decimum affirmat, That uppon the speeches aforesaide of
the said Dell, this examinate woulde
not accepte of the foresaid freighte to the Matheraes
but resolved with the Master to take what freighte they
coulde gett at Lancerott for Teneriffe, and presently
with the best expedicon that they could gett the Mathew
off the grounde where shee lay to bee repaired and
fitted for the said Corne voyage for the Matheraes,
soe that the Spaniardes might at pleasure come
aboard her, and commannde her and gett her afloate,
and tooke in what freighte they coulde gett which
was about halfe her ladeinge of Corne, and departed
thense for Teneriffe where shee arrived
in May 1634 stilo
Romano, and there was then in her belonging to the
said Delabarr onely a small quantity of Corne
which was the proceed of his twelve ppeeces of welsh
Cotton and hee saieth that they made the more haste to come
frm Lancerott because this examinate and the Master
by reason of the speeches aforesaid of Dell were fearfull
that shee woulde have bin seized at Lancerott as a 
flemishe builte shippe, and because shee had spente
soe much tyme to losse, whereas yf that feare had
