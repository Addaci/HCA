tooke into the said shipp at Dansike was noe hindrance or preiudice to the corne

corne then was laden abord her. Et aliter nescit.

Ad decimum tertium articulum dicit that in their passage from Dansike to Elsanore the

foresaid storme, to keepe the shipp up from going to the Lee shore, hee beleeveth
that if shee had bin never soe stoute and staunch a shipp shee must have given
way, and have endamaged her lading thereby, aliter satisfecit in predepoits suis.
ad qua se refert, saying that in his iudgement and as hee verily beleeveth the
damage happened by the shipps giving way in the storme aforesaid and not by
meanes of any overlading of her.

that they then went freely on shore there to see their corne measured and helpe

at the said porte of Alborne when any of the company went at any time on
shore before they had contracted for their corne and had libertie to take in the

have bin seized or and molested by the Moores, And this hee saith
hee is the rather induced to beleeve, because that for about a weekes

to sayle and goe to Albozine there to receive and take in her lading of
corne and to carry and transporte the same from thence to Cales arlate
and there to discharge and deliver the same. This hee knoweth
to be true (ut dicit) because hee was then in at frigott Tuta in a frigate
in company of the said shipp the Talbott, of which frigate the said Joseph
part owner
Blowe was master and this deponent was on board her, and this
deponent heard the one of the said merchant fraighters on board the said

and company sett saile with the said shipp the Charles and
carried away with them the said Turkish shipp soe surprized

because the said Hawkins had soe taken and carried away the said Turkish
shipp, and that they should not be released unlesse the said shipp
were restored and her lading were restored, This hee knoweth because
hee was acquainted with the bringing of the said message, his boate

said Roade of Albozine and that the said shipp the Talbott was taking in
her said lading of corne and had taken in about foure score hannocks

afraide of the said shipp the Charles made in againe for shore in the said
Baye of Albozine, and being still persued by the said shipp the Charles
the said Turckish shipp came as neere to the shore as shee well could and

reported in those parts that there was peace and amitie betwixt England
and Algiers and their respective subiects, and that it was free

the Tabbott were there sett uppon and surprized by the Moores to the

escape by swimming was killed, which hee saith was donne by order
of the said Governour whoe was there in person at such their
surprizall (as three others of their men brought word that escaped by
swimming) and saith the said seaventeene men were detained and
comitted to prison and not suffered to retourne on board the
said shipp unlesse satisfaction were first made for the said wronge
and iniury soe comitted by the said Captaine Hawkins in taking the

there to procure moneys and take some course for the enlargement of the said
company soe imprisoned at Albozine aforesaid, and to hire other men in

did at the costs and charges of the said owners hire other men to the number
of sixteene or thereabouts to serve in the said shipp in the roome and stead
of those that were soe taken and imprisoned as aforesaid, which said men soe
hired were brought from St Lucas and most of them this deponent sawe on board their said shipp. And from and after the premisses
this deponent was at Cales cleered off the said shipp, and there hee left

Ad ultimu dicit predepoita per eum xxxxxxxx esse vera.

Ad Interria.

Ad primu respondet that hee this rendent was one of the shipps company interr,
the voyage interrogated, being Gunner on board her, and saith the Moores at
and neere Albozine aforesaid are a heathenish and barbarous people, and
such as hee beleeveth will say say or doe any thinge for their owne ends
and proffitt, and a people not to bee beleeved or trusted by Christians, and
for such hee saith they were and are commonly accompted and reputed,
aliter nescit.

Ad secundum respondet that in regard of the falsenes and barbarousnes of the
said Moores at such shipps as belonge to any Christians and goe thither to
lade doe usually (as hee hath often heard and verily beleeveth) carry some
Jew in their shipps to goe on shore and to treate and trade for them, and
to that purpose their said master carried a Jew in his said shipp, whoe
was provided by the merchant fraighters at Sata to goe on shore and treate
and bargaine with the Alcada at Sat Albozine interr, which said Jew
hee saith was one of the company soe seized upon by the Moores as
hee hath before deposed, and after such their seizure the said Moores
utterly refused to deliver or restore them unlesse they were ransoned with
the Alcada
money, howbeit hee saith that at the first ⁁ they offered to restore them
in case the said Turkish shipp soe taken by Captaine Hawkins and her
his were xxx delivered up and released. And hee saith it will be
neither
~~~
HCA 13/61 f.32v Annotate

neither proffitt nor losse to him this deponent in case Sentence should
be given for or against Captaine Hawkins his owners or any of them in this
cause.

Ad 3 respondet that hee hath often heard that when shipps belonging to Christians
bee to Albozine to trade and traffique the shipps company doe usually keepe
bee
on board and not adventure to goe on shore unlesse they ⁁ well armed with
gunns of is interr, or els that the moores in case they finde oportunitie doe
often usually make seizure of them and take and keepe them prisoners till they
be bought off with money or otherwise, But of this use of theirs hee
saith hee cannot of his owne knowledge depose forasmuch as hee was
never there before hee went the voyage in question./

Ad quartum respondet that such behaviour and dealing of the said Moores
in falfying their words and taking the company prisoners is very
well knowne at Mallegae and Cales and other places thereabouts, for
this respondent hath often in those places heard it spoken off of, insomuch
that they will not trade with them without hostages for their true
performance, and saith the said Blowe and company knew and
heard thereof before they went the said voyage, and diverse of the company
(whereof this respondent was one) exprest much unwillingnes to goe the
said voyage, untill the merchants that fraighted them promised them
somthinge to drincke, over and above their wages,
and promised to ransome such of them as should happen to be seized
upon by the said Moores, And such promise that the said merchants
had soe promised and undertaken their said master informed them
before they went from Suta for Albozine aforesaid. And hee saith
that for some certaine dayes after their first arrivall at
Albozine they their men that had occasion to goe on shore, went well
armed, but afterwards when they had libertie grannted them to trade there
they went unarmed, and were unarmed when they were soe seized,
for which hee holdeth them unwise and over seene, but yet hee saith
they had two moores on board for hostages when the said men were
soe seized. Et aliter nescit, for hee was not in the said shipp at
such her retourne.

Ad ultimum nescit deposuit et nescit, saving hee saith
that although the said Moores are a very false and
people, yet considering howe freely they suffered their men to come on
shore and retourne not uninterrupted (though unarmed) bef for diverse
dayes after they had gotten leave to
trade with them, and untill the said Captaine Hawkins had soe taken
the said Turkish shipp, hee verily beleeveth they would not
have surprized or seized their said men, had not the said Captaine
Hawkins soe taken the said Turkish shipp./

frequently were cary with them a Jew or Moore whom they send on shore to mediate
and endeavour for their trade and lading, And saith that the said Captaine Hawkins
the voyage in question had a Jen on board his shipp the Charles for whom hee sent
a shore at Alborne to that purpose, of this deponents knowledge whoe went all
